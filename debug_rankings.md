Zion National Park is Utah's first national park, and the most visited of Utah's Mighty 5. Zion Canyon is the centerpiece and most popular part of the park. Zion Canyon was carved by the Virgin River over millions of years! You might know Zion by its bucket-list hikes — Angels Landing and the Narrows are two of the most popular — but you don't have to be an experienced hiker to soak in the epic scenery Zion has to offer. Our guide includes a day hike for everyone, whether you're looking for a family-friendly stroll along the river or a heart-pounding climb with the canyon sprawling below you.

There are 5 areas where you can hike in Zion: [Zion Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-trail-descriptions.htm), [East Rim](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/east-rim-wilderness-trail-descriptions.htm), [Kolob Canyons](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/kolob-canyons-wilderness-hiking-trails.htm), [Kolob Terrace](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/kolob-terrace-wilderness-trail-descriptions.htm), and [Southwest Desert](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/southwest-desert-wilderness-hiking-trails.htm). The most popular and easily accessible hikes are in the Zion Canyon area. The other areas are wilderness areas that offer more rugged hikes. It takes a little extra effort to travel to those areas, but the reward is fewer fellow hikers on the trail.

From March through November, the park runs [2 free shuttle routes](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm), the Zion Canyon Line and the Springdale Line. The Zion Canyon Line operates within the park, with shuttle stops near popular trailheads. The Springdale Line operates outside the park, with stops at locations in the town of Springdale and at Zion Canyon Village. You don't need a ticket or reservation to ride the shuttles — just hop on and off at any shuttle stop. Remember that when the shuttles are in operation, you can't drive a personal vehicle along Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, but you can still drive to other areas of the park.

Zion is open 24 hours a day, year-round. Spring and fall are the best times to visit for the mildest weather, but the park is beautiful all year. If you visit from March through November, remember that most of the hikes in Zion Canyon are only accessible via the free park shuttle.

There is an [entrance fee](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/fees.htm) to visit Zion. You can only purchase an entrance pass in person at one of the park's entrance stations.

Not crowdedGreat conditionsGreat views

It’s one of the under appreciated trails in **Zion National Park**. It has beautiful views and very few people hiking it. At the end one can add the Emerald Pools to make a bit more strenuous and catch them in the afternoon light.

Difficulty:Easy

This was the most beautiful trail we have done so far, with beautiful landscapes and the element water is very present alongside the path making it magical. The entrance inside the Mt **Zion National Park** is 35euro for each car, and it is valid for 7 days. The trail depicted on AllTrails, unfortunately it calculated from our start from our hotel in Springdale. So we have to subtract about 5.7miles.

We thought this was stunning. The view at the end is spectacular- you look down in **Zion National Park** from 7000ft elevation. Breathtaking. But the walk itself was also enjoyable. Smooth trail that was easy to follow. Yes, a little bit of elevation up and down but nothing crazy. So quiet and peaceful. Wilderness experience!

Great views

Bucketlist hike in the **Zion National Park**. Brought my trekking pole which I was very grateful to have it. It was a 10 mile hike crossing the river against the current and the river rocks can be very slippery and saw a few people slip. Most stops at the “Wall Street” but we continued maybe a mile more. Water level can go up at waist level in certain areas and saw some with waterproof cover for their backpack which was really nice. This is a very crowded place but very fun. A must next to Angel’s landing but that one requires a permit and this does not.
