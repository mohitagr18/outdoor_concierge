Grand Canyon National Park in northwestern Arizona is an iconic destination at the top of many travelers' bucket lists. The highlight of the park, of course, is a gorge carved by the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon is the largest canyon in the United States, measuring up to %{18\_miles} wide, %{277\_miles} long, and %{6000\_feet} deep! The Colorado River has been carving the canyon for more than 5 million years. The process has revealed rock layers that are much older — the youngest rock layer, the Kaibab Formation, is 270 million years old!

Hiking is one of the best ways to experience this amazing geological wonder, and the South Rim of the park offers a trail for everyone. Short, family-friendly hikes offer sweeping vistas of the canyon from viewpoints along the rim. For experienced hikers, there are several trails that descend into the canyon with epic views along the way. No matter which trail you choose, make sure you're prepared before setting out. Take enough food and water, and don't forget sun protection. Go slowly and know your limits. Hikes into the canyon can be especially deceptive — remember to save enough energy for the hike back up to the rim.

In addition to driving, there are [other ways to travel to the South Rim](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/directions_s_rim.htm). Grand Canyon Airport is about %{7\_miles} from the South Rim, and you can take a flight there from the Las Vegas area and a few nearby cities. [Buses](https://www.nps.gov/grca/getinvolved/cua-list.htm) are also available, including the [shuttle from the nearby town of Tusayan](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/tusayan-route-purple.htm), which operates from late May through early September. If you're interested in the scenic route, Amtrak offers service to Flagstaff, or you can take the historic [Grand Canyon Railway](https://www.thetrain.com/) from the town of Williams right to the South Rim!

Once you've arrived at the South Rim, there are lots of [ways to get around the park](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/gettingaround.htm). Guided tours are available by bus, bicycle, or even mule! If you want to explore the park at your own pace, the [free shuttle](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/shuttle-buses.htm) is your best bet. There are 4 shuttle routes, and 3 of them operate year-round. The Hermits Rest (Red) Route operates from March through November, and the road is closed to private vehicles during that time. You don't need a ticket to ride the shuttle, and they arrive at clearly marked stops every 15 to 30 minutes.

The best time to visit the Grand Canyon is in spring and fall when the weather is mildest. The South Rim of the park is open 24 hours a day, year-round, though it can be quite busy in summer. If you've visited the South Rim before and are looking to shake the crowds, check out some less-traveled hikes on the North Rim!

There is an [entrance fee](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/fees.htm) to visit the park, which you can pay online in advance or in person at various locations in and around the park.

[Timothy D](https://www.alltrails.com/members/timothy-duong-7)

Nov 25, 2025·Hiking

I went all the way down to the Colorado River and Phantom Ranch which adds several miles and around 1500 ft of elevation gain compared to what AllTrails says. Do not attempt a Rim to River to Rim in one day unless you've already completed a 20 mile hike with around 5000 ft of elevation gain before. This will be even harder than that because most of the uphill is towards the end when you are most tired unlike most hikes where the uphill is at the beginning. The best way to do this is to take South Kaibab down and Bright Angel up as South Kaibab has better views of the canyon and Bright Angel has more water refill options (though don't count on them to be running all the time). If you are staying in the **Grand Canyon** Village, take the Hiker's Express shuttle to the South Kaibab trailhead. The weather at the end November was around 25-30 °F at the top in the morning but it quickly warms up once you pass Ooh Aah Point. You'll be quite warm to begin with since the bus is heated, but you should still bring warm layers in case you don't finish before sunset. There was no snow or ice at any point, but some parts were muddy. Since the River Trail and Silver Bridge are closed for construction after checking out the river and Phantom Ranch you need to go back up South Kaibab until you reach the junction for the Tonto trail, where you go west a few miles until you reach Bright Angel at Havasupai Gardens. The water was running at Havasupai Gardens according to the sign, but not at the two resthouses on Bright Angel. At this time of year the temperature never got too hot (the thermometer at Havasupai Gardens read 54 °F at 4 p.m.) so I carried all the water I needed and only ended up drinking around 2 L. It started to get quite cold near the end but since that part is uphill I was warm enough with 2 layers. Overall, this was a stunning hike and I hope to be back for a Rim to Rim once everything is restored.
