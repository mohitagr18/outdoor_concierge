1. The One Missing Piece (For Later)
Currently, 
fetch_rankings.py
 relies on a hardcoded map (PARK_URL_MAP) to know that ZION -> utah/zion-national-park. To support specific parks on demand (like "Big Bend" or "Acadia") without hardcoding all 63 parks, we will eventually need to update 
fetch_rankings.py
 to either:

Auto-Generate Slugs: Try state/full-park-name logic.
Search First: Use a quick search on AllTrails to find the correct URL if it's not in our map.
