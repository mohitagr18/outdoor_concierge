Portions of the trail are relatively flat and can be traveled by wheelchairs and strollers. Other sections have numerous narrow stairs and can be difficult to those with mobility issues or strollers. This is the best trail for anyone wanting to see much of what Bandelier is known for without a long walk.<br /> <br /> As you walk, you will see evidence of the people who lived here in the past. The remnants of stone structures and many carved or a few painted images on the rock walls provide indications of the Ancestral Pueblo people who inhabited this area and the lives they lived. In addition to these physical artifacts, we also gather clues to these past lives from the modern descendants who still live in the pueblos around us. Frijoles (free-HOH-lace) Canyon maintains very important connections for today\u2019s Pueblo people. Please treat this area with respect. You can help the National Park Service preserve this cultural heritage for all to experience. Any disturbance is vandalism and against the law.",

      "bodyText": "Bandelier was established as a National Monument in 1916, but until the mid-30\u2019s the only visitor facility in Frijoles Canyon was a lodge built in 1909 by Judge A. J. Abbott. Even by 1925 when George and Evelyn Frey acquired the lease to run the lodge, the only way for visitors to access the canyon bottom and the lodge was on foot.<br /> <br /> In 1932, when Bandelier was transferred from the United States Forest Service to the National Park Service, Frank \u201cBoss\u201d Pinkley was the Superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments. He knew that to make it possible for more people to visit Bandelier, improved facilities and better access into the canyon were necessary. When the Emergency Conservation Work Act in 1933 created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), funding and workers became available to do this work.<br /> <br /> The CCC was a Depression-era program designed to produce public works while providing much-needed jobs and work experience for men between the ages of 17 and 26. With the desperate nationwide lack of employment, young men welcomed the opportunity to get room, board, and training. As soon as a CCC camp was approved for Bandelier, \u201cBoss\u201d Pinkley began putting together plans for the road into the canyon and facilities for visitors. It was considered very important for park structures to harmonize with the environment and local culture, so a regionally popular style often called Pueblo Revival was chosen. The Park Service architect, Lyle Bennett, had worked on several other Park Service and CCC buildings in the Southwest and was well schooled in this style.<br /> <br /> The first project, the road, was opened as a truck trail in 1933. Over the next 8 years the enrollees built 31 stone buildings for visitor facilities, Park Service residences, offices, the fire tower and entrance station, along with the hand-carved wood furniture and pierced-tin light fixtures to furnish them. Their work also included building trails, helping archeologists stabilize the Ancestral Pueblo sites, and widening and completing the road.",

This area was originally built to be the park campground. In 1963, the campground was moved to the mesa top near the park entrance and the old campsites converted into a picnic area. Look for a building on the hill to your left. Completed in 1934, this campground comfort station was the first permanent building constructed by the CCC in Bandelier. Since people often camped for weeks at a time, the comfort station included showers and laundry facilities. The plumbing and electricity for the comfort station was cut off by the 2011 flooding.

The road is particularly significant because it was the CCC\u2019s first project here, and it was a real engineering and construction challenge. Until that time the only way to enter the canyon was a steep, switchback walking trail, now known as the Frey Trail, about a half mile up the canyon. To provide the opportunity for more visitors to use the park, a road was a real necessity. Within about a month after the CCC camp was established, the enrollees had built a 12-foot-wide truck trail, which they widened and completed later. It was carefully planned to provide the maximum view of the canyon upon entry, while providing the least possible visual intrusion from the canyon bottom, and the original route and roadbed are still in use. As you drive out of the park, you may notice the original stone gutters, which are carefully maintained. You may also notice several stone houses back from the left side of the road; the CCC built these as residences for park staff and the Superintendent. About a quarter of a mile up the road is a service road (open to employees only). It leads to the stables, which were originally built to house horses for the guests to rent.",

It contained restrooms and was used for storage of linens and the boiler for this complex.<br /> <br /> Each cabin unit has a corner fireplace and was originally furnished completely with CCC hand-made furniture. Most of the furniture is presently in protective storage. The wall material in all the CCC buildings is tuff blocks quarried from the mesa top. The quarry area is now used as the amphitheater in Juniper Campground, where Ranger programs are held on summer evenings. Here in the cabin area is a good place to notice that the walls angle in from bottom to top, which is called \u201cbattered.\u201d",

Mrs. Frey always said that she started it with a cutting from a wild canyon grape plant she found along the Rio Grande near the mouth of Frijoles Creek. The windows above it are part of the residence built for Mrs. Frey, which she occupied until her death in 1988; it is now the Superintendent\u2019s office and conference room. The windows across the patio from the Snack Bar door look out of what was the lodge dining room. The patio itself is now filled with picnic tables, but when there were overnight guests staying at the Lodge, it was used for socializing. On some evenings, Pueblo people on the staff would present traditional dances for the guests. Surrounding the patio is another good example of a portal, just as welcome on a hot day now as it was in the 1940\u2019s. On your right notice the wooden gates leading into the patio from the parking lot. The walls on either side of them were originally more than a foot taller, which must have made this space quiet and private, but probably also made it harder for visitors to find their way in.",

You will see them inside, and jutting out from the roof about every 4 feet. Each hand-peeled Ponderosa log extends the full width of the structure.<br /> Canales (kah-NAH-lace) - roof drain spouts. Each consists of a log cut to make a drain and then lined with metal, often copper.<br /> Lintels - large squared-off wooden beams over the doorways and windows.<br /> Corbels - supporting blocks at each end of the vigas, often decoratively shaped or carved.<br /> Latillas (luh-TEE-yuhs) - whole or split saplings placed across the vigas to help support the roof.<br /> Bancos (BAHN-kohz) - bench-style built-in seats, usually made of masonry. They are often found on either side of fireplaces.Parapets - raised walls surrounding a flat roof. Canales (drains) are cut through them.<br /> Walls - here, the thick masonry walls are made of blocks of tuff (volcanic ash.). They were originally covered in earthen, lime, or cement plaster.

The latillas in this room are arranged in a diagonal or herringbone pattern, while others in the complex are usually laid perpendicular to the vigas. The fancy diagonal pattern is usually reserved for public use buildings rather than offices or quarters. The flooring is chunks of native volcanic rock.

There is another corner fireplace in the book store, as well as more tin light fixtures in the museum.",

Young Pablita Velarde of Santa Clara Pueblo was hired to paint scenes of traditional Pueblo culture as illustrations for the museum cases. She went on to become one of the best-known Pueblo artists. As Pablita later said about her work, \u201cThis period of my life at Bandelier, I figure, I\u2019ve learned more about my own people \u2026 than I would have \u2026 and I appreciate what the old ones have tried to pass on \u2026 I want the earth to remember me through my work.\u201d",

Plants also play a role in shaping the canyon. Their roots penetrate susceptible areas and pave the way for water or ice to break a rock\u2019s grip on its neighbor.On occasion, this slow, plodding process is rapidly advanced by flash flooding. In these instances, rocks, trees, and water are carried ever further on their journey to the Rio Grande and ultimately the ocean.

Cottonwoods get their names from the cotton-like strands that catch the breeze and transport the seeds. Narrowleaf cottonwood can easily be confused with willows. In early spring, willows are distinguished from cottonwoods because they only have one bud scale, which forms a little cap over the developing flower. Before the flood events in 2011 and 2013, willows were rare in this part of the canyon due to the dominance of ponderosa pine. The pines created a thick overstory that blocked light from the willows. The floods downed many tall pines and deposited fresh soils. The new environment seems to benefit the willows.\u00a0</p>",

In the canyons, oaks grow into small trees up to 60 feet tall, but usually remain short and shrubby on the drier mesas. The acorns of these trees are an important food for wildlife such as black bears, jays, and rock squirrels. The Ancestral Pueblo people ate these acorns too. Acorns are usually boiled before eating to remove acid that makes them taste very bitter. In autumn, oaks turn yellow or red. However, the dead brown leaves do not fall until the next spring, when new growth begins.\u00a0</p>",

From studying tree rings scientists know that the natural fire cycle here was a low intensity fire every fifteen years or so. In recent decades several large-scale landscape altering fires have affected this terrain. All of these fires have been caused by human activity. Las Conchas Wildfire in 2011 was the largest, intensely burning over \u00be of the park and having impacts far into the future. That fire reached the mesa across the canyon from you and threatened to destroy the historic park visitor center in the canyon below until heroic firefighting efforts quelled its progress. Look at the difference in vegetation from this side of the canyon to far side. That is the result of fire removing most of the larger trees and leaving more open grasslands.",

In recent years it is not uncommon for this stream to dry up in summer from near Alcove House and downstream. Before Las Conchas Fire in 2011 this stream ran at least past the visitor center during all seasons. Since water is so important to life in the arid southwest, it is reasonable to assume that during much of the 400 years the Ancestral Pueblo lived here this was a year-round water source.<br /> <br /> Water is important to support a diversity of plant life that in turn encourages a wider variety of wildlife. This area near the creek, called a riparian area, hosts the widest array of life in the entire 33,000+ acre monument. Giant water loving cottonwoods and shorter box elder and willow trees line the creekside. Ponderosa pines, junipers, and pi\u00f1on pine are also found here. This rich array of plant life attracts deer, rabbits, and a host of birds that were important food to the Ancestral Pueblo people.",

      "bodyText": "Frijoles Canyon is carved into a thick layer of volcanic ash that over time compacted into a soft rock known as tuff. This ash was deposited over 1 million years ago in two separate eruptions of the Jemez Volcano, each spewing over 600 times more ash than Mt St Helens in 1980. Tuff is a malleable rock overall and one component within the tuff, pumice, is especially susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Using this quality of the tuff, Ancestral Pueblo people used harder rock, such as basalt found further down this canyon and under the tuff, to enlarge natural erosional cavities into human excavated openings called cavates (CAVE-eights). You will be able to climb ladders into several of these further down the trail.If you are interested in learning more about this fantastic volcanic geology, visit the Valles Caldera National Preserve located about 40 minutes away on Highway 4. The Preserve protects the collapsed top (caldera) of the Jemez Volcano.",

These plants often still flourish near places the Ancestral Pueblo people once called home.\u00a0",

Both provided important sustenance to the Ancestral Pueblo people, one in the form of pine nuts and the other a tart but healthy berry. Three-leaf Sumac, an indigenous bush that has tangy berries, could be made into drink with a sharp taste similar to lemonade.

How about the one of an elk to the left of the macaw?<br /> <br /> The people of Frijoles Canyon lived, worked, laughed, and died here for over four centuries. In that time, they learned to grow crops, read the weather and the stars, use the abundant natural resources, and live comfortably. However, like all cultures and all societies, things change. Frijoles and the surrounding areas of Bandelier were not abandoned. There was no mysterious migration or sudden disappearance of its people. Old systems gave way to new traditions and ways of life. Although the pueblo people have not lived in the canyon since the late 1500\u2019s, a deep spiritual connection still exists. Pueblo residents often come to visit, remember, and teach the next generation about life in the canyon when their ancestors lived here. We can do the same and take care of it for future generations.<br /> <br /> This is the end of the Pueblo Loop Trail. Continuing and crossing the creek will bring you to the junction with the Alcove House Trail. Turn right to go the half mile to Alcove House, another cliff dwelling 140 feet above the canyon floor with four large ladders to climb up and down. Or turn left to return the half mile back to the Visitor Center and parking. In winter it may be best to back track on the trail you just walked, as the rest of the trail and the creek crossing, can be slick and icy.",

      "bodyText": "This is Talus House, reconstructed in 1920 to show the structures that would have been found in front of many of the cavates when the Ancestral Pueblo people were still occupying the canyon. For many years park staff believed the reconstruction was inaccurate due to what appears to be doorways in the front of each room block. However, in recent years, when Talus House received some much-needed TLC to its eroding roof, we discovered that the original rebuilds did indeed include doorways in the roofs that at some point were covered over during past maintenance. Having an opening or doorway in the roof undoubtedly added to the difficulty of keeping the structure intact and reminds us of the constant maintenance that would have been done regularly when these building were inhabited. What appeared to be doorways in the front were actually included to allow visitors a view inside the structures.",

To your left you can see the Frey Trail that carries visitors from the canyon to Juniper Campground. Although today it is a wide dirt trail it was probably a much simpler path in Ancestral Pueblo times. Would you have wanted to hike up from the canyon carrying the farming implements you would need to plant your fields? Imagine how different this view would have been with the many standing structures and farm fields across this mesa during the time the Ancestral Pueblo people called it home.<br /> <br /> If you haven\u2019t done so already, it is highly recommended that you walk the Pueblo Loop Trail you see below.

You are approximately 0.25 miles down this trail that passes through the Pi\u00f1on-Juniper Woodland and provides excellent views of Frijoles Canyon, the Pueblo Loop Trail, and the park visitor center. In summer, watch for thunderstorms that can develop very quickly over the mountains posing a threat to unwary hikers.<br /> <br /> From 1150 \u2013 1550 CE the Ancestral Pueblo people called this area home doing much of their farming here on the dry mesas using creative water saving techniques to survive in this arid landscape. The area and the sites you will see still hold deep spiritual and cultural connections to today\u2019s Pueblo peoples. Please treat these sites with the respect they deserve. <p>\u00a0</p>",

      "bodyText": "You are now on Tsankawi mesa. \u00a0Even though you have climbed, you are still in the Pi\u00f1on-Juniper Woodland. \u00a0You can see both trees in great numbers on the mesa. \u00a0You can also spot the sharp-edged leaves of a banana yucca (yucca baccata), forming a rosette at the base of the plant. \u00a0In early summer, a stalk of soft creamy white flowers may arise from this otherwise hostile-looking plant. Yuccas were very important to the Ancestral Pueblo people. \u00a0Almost all parts of the plant are edible including the flowers, the fruits, and the roots. \u00a0Soap is made from the roots and the thorns at the end of each waxy leaf make excellent needles for the thready fibers pulled from the leaves. \u00a0<br /> <br /> Continue straight on this trail for the best views. \u00a0Please do not create additional trails along the mesa top.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0",
