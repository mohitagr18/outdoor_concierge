There are 3 loops in the campground named for local wildlife: Abert's Squirrel Loop, Black Bear Loop, and Coyote Loop. The campground is located in the pinyon-juniper woodland which means there is minimal shade as both of these types of trees are short. An occasional Ponderosa pine towers above the other vegetation providing some shade especially in the Coyote Loop of the campground. The campground is paved and each campground space includes a picnic table and in-ground grill. Each loop also has a restroom facility with a paved walkway leading to it. There are no hookups or showers in the campground but there is a dump station located just adjacent to it.",
