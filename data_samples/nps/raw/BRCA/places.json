    "bodyText": "<p>At Agua Canyon two prominent hoodoos command attention. On the left, is the taller of the two towers, \"The Hunter.\" To the right is a hoodoo commonly referred to as the \"Rabbit\" or alternatively the \"Backpacker.\" In the early years of Bryce Canyon National Park a great effort was made to name many of the more prominent hoodoos. Over the years many of these have fallen or partially fallen so that they look nothing like the things they were originally named for. As a result hoodoos are no longer being named and many of the more obscure names are being dropped from newer publications. The good news is that you, the park visitor, now have the liberty to exercise your own creativity. Is the rabbit a backpacker or maybe even a thumb? It's up to you to decide. Let your imagination run!</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>No trails depart from this area. The Agua Connecting Trail (currently closed due to rockslide) is found at Ponderosa Canyon, the next overlook to the north.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain still looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today. By following the eastern horizon you may be able to see the southern tip of the Kaiparowits plateau, which is separated from Navajo Mountain by the Colorado River within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Tall, charismatic hoodoos are visible nearly at eye level from this view. These are created from the iron-rich mudstones and limestones of the park's Claron formation through repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Note the presence of limber pines (Pinus flexilis) atop the hoodoo known as \"the Hunter\", likely cached there as seeds by a Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana).<br /> The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view beyond. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Below these Pink Cliffs, observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p>",

Descending from the rim, this trail meanders through forests and meadows, offering stunning views of pink-hued cliffs in the distance. The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest and the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north, the Tushar Mountains and Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p>",

Roosevelt as a task force to work on a wide variety of conservation and public works projects, the CCC's objective was primarily unemployment relief. It provided work for a total of 3 million people--mostly young men during its existence. Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work. Notable projects included the Under-the-Rim Trail from Rainbow Point to Bryce Point, structures at Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail gazebo, and front-country campground development. Camp NP-3 operated from 1934 until the camp was disbanded in 1943. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/brca/hrs5d.htm\">Read More</a></p>",

Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails and as high as this trail. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p> <h3>The Grand Staircase</h3> <p>The Grand Staircase is an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. In the 1870s, geologist Clarence Dutton first conceptualized this region as a huge stairway ascending out of the bottom of the Grand Canyon northward with the cliff edge of each layer forming giant steps. Dutton divided this layer cake of Earth history into five steps that he colorfully named Pink Cliffs, Grey Cliffs, White Cliffs, Vermilion Cliffs, and Chocolate Cliffs. Since then, modern geologists have further divided Dutton's steps into individual rock formations.<br /> What makes the Grand Staircase worldly unique is that it preserves more Earth history than any other place on Earth. Geologists often liken the study of sedimentary rock layers to reading a history book--layer by layer, detailed chapter by detailed chapter. The problem is that in most places in the world, the book has been severely damaged by the rise and fall of mountains, the scouring of glaciers, etc. Usually these chapters are completely separated from each other and often whole pages are just missing. Yet the Grand Staircase and the lower cliffs that comprise the Grand Canyon remain largely intact speaking to over 600 million years of continuous Earth history with only a few paragraphs missing here and there.<br /> Unfortunately, the Grand Staircase is such a vast region of rock that no matter where you stand on its expanse, most of it will be hidden behind the curvature of Earth. Places such as Yovimpa Point, the Bristlecone Loop trail, and the north slope of the Kaibab Plateau are the exception where even a non-geologist can discern the individual chapters of this colossal history book--these immense steps of Dutton's Grand Staircase.</p> <h3>Fire</h3> <p>Natural fire is a good and necessary part of this landscape. It promotes new growth, diversity of species, removes sick and dead plant matter, and limits insect populations and the spread of plant disease. Without fire, forests become crowded, diseased, less diverse, and ultimately create conditions for large-scale destructive wildfire. In ponderosa forests within the park, fire was once common on a 3-7 year cycle, as lightning strikes would ignite low-intensity ground fires. The Ponderosa pine's thick bark protects healthy trees from the flames, while clearing the ground for new growth. At higher elevations, mixed conifer forests would burn on 11-25 year cycles, allowing first grasses, then shrubs and trees like Quaking Aspen to thrive in newly opened space.<br /> Over the last 150 years, a history of fire suppression has deprived many western forests of the benefits of fire, creating large-scale beetle attacks, loss of biodiversity, and a build-up of dead and dry plant matter ready to ignite.<br /> Here at Bryce Canyon, fire crews are working to provide these forests with the fire they need. This often begins with mechanical thinning: cutting down dead, diseased, and overcrowded trees and building burn piles that are ignited in winter. You may see these piles throughout the park.<br /> This is often a first step before broadcast ground fires can be set--if too much plant matter is present, the fire can easily grow beyond control. Burn piles reduce vegetation to a manageable level. They also help fire crews defend areas of the park when lightning starts an unexpected fire. Previous fuels reduction work in the Rainbow Point area was crucial to wildland fire crews' ability to safely manage the August 2018 Riggs and Lonely fires, which burned over 2,200 acres across National Forest, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service land to the southeast of Rainbow Point.</p>",

Visitors can also find restrooms, showers, camping supplies including firewood, and souveniers.<br /> The General Store is typically closed between January and March.</p> <h3>Camp Center and Bryce Inn</h3> <p>Constructed by the Utah Parks Company in 1932--the same year as the Old Administration Building (High Plateau Institute) to the south. Designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, who also designed the park's Lodge, this structure was designated the central unit in the Utah Parks Company\u2019s \u201chousekeeping camp unit\". After the deluxe cabins and Bryce Lodge, this was the last major improvement in the park designed by Underwood.\u00a0\u00a0Available evidence suggests the Utah Parks Company intended to use the cafeteria building as a center of operations once the Lodge was closed for the season. It soon became evident the building was too small for this purpose.<br /> This area once contained housekeeping tents, along with simple guest cabins, sanitary facilities, and support buildings which were removed from 1974-1989.\u00a0<br /> In September of 1954, its name was changed from Bryce Canyon cafeteria and camp center to Bryce Canyon Inn. Sometime after the removal of the surrounding structures\u00a0the building was renamed to the General Store.<br /> In 1994 the building was submitted to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of Gilbert Stanley Underwood's Rustic architectural design.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h3>The Utah Parks Company at Bryce Canyon</h3> <p>The Utah Parks Company\u00a0(UPC) was a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, which owned and operated restaurants, lodging, and bus tours in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument from the 1920s until 1972. Before Bryce Canyon became a national park, the Union Pacific Railroad had conceived these parks and monuments as forming\u00a0a \"Grand Circle\", which would ultimately be visited first by arrival at a rail depot in Lund, Utah (near present day Cedar City) and then by bus to the UPC-owned El Escalante hotel in Cedar City, and then to the parks themselves. To accomodate these visitors, the Utah Parks Company financed the construction of the Bryce Canyon Lodge, numerous cabins and other less permanent accomodations, the General Store, and later the Historic Service Station. After the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park in 1928, UPC would serve as the park's sole concessionaire until competition from private motor vehicles and other operating costs would lead to their liquidiation and donation of all assets within the park to the National Park Service in 1972.</p>",

With the exception of vehicles measuring 23\u00a0feet/7\u00a0meters or longer, which are restricted from the Bryce Amphitheater during shuttle hours, riding the shuttle is not mandatory. However, by riding our buses you will support our efforts to keep our parking lots from growing any larger, to keep our pure air as clean as possible, and to provide enough room in our little park for everyone to experience the magic of Bryce Canyon.<br /> <br /> The Bryce Amphitheater Shuttle\u00a0runs regularly on 15 minute intervals from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. with extended hours to 8 p.m. in summer, and brings visitors to areas of interest, viewpoints, and trailheads within the Bryce Amphitheater area of the park. The shuttle is free with park admission.</p> <h4>How to use the Shuttle</h4> <p>There is no extra fee to use the shuttle system. Paying your entrance fee to Bryce Canyon entitles you and your vehicle's occupants to unlimited use of the Bryce Canyon Shuttle buses.<br /> <br /> Annual Passes waive the entrance fee to not only this park but all other National Park Service Areas and other Federal lands that may have fees, across the entire country. If you do not already have one of these annual passes they can be purchased at the entrance to the park.<br /> <br /> If you are not staying overnight inside the park at either the Bryce Canyon Lodge or North or Sunset Campground, we strongly encourage you to leave your vehicle outside the park. Please park and board the shuttle at the Shuttle Station (near Ruby's Inn, on the left side of the road before entering the park) or at Ruby's Campground.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/shuttle.htm\">Read more about the Shuttle</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Perhaps the most iconic of the park's viewpoints, Bryce Point provides a soaring view of the Bryce Amphitheater from the south. Southern Paiutes call this place Unka Tumpi Wun-nux Tungwatsini Xoopakichu Anax, which means \"Red Rock Standing Like a Man in a Hole\". These hole or bowl-shaped areas--called amphitheaters--contain the world's greatest concentration of irregular rock spires called \"hoodoos\". There is a Southern Paiute word for \"scary\" or \"spirit\" pronounced \"oo'doo\", which has been associated with this place.\u00a0A sacred oral tradition of the Southern Paiute states that these hoodoos are ancient \u201cLegend People\u201d turned into stone by the trickster god Coyote as a punishment for bad deeds.<br /> The view and the park share the same namesake, Ebenezer Bryce, who settled in the Paria Valley to the east in 1870. Bryce lived here for only five years, but in that time, the canyon that a timber road he built travelled into\u00a0became known as \"Bryce's canyon\" to the people who knew him. Ebenezer Bryce was a pragmatic man, constructing roads to facilitate lumber transport and surveying the route for a 10-mile irrigation ditch from the top of the plateau to the valley that would later lead to larger, more permanent settlements.</p> <h3>Trails</h3> <p>At the north end of the parking lot, the 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Peekaboo Loop and 4.0 mile (6.4 km) Hat Shop trails descend below the rim. Both of these are strenuous hikes. Closer to the viewpoint, the 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail has its southern beginning here--varying from easy to moderate difficulty as it connects to Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise, and Fairyland Points. Note that the section from Bryce to Inspiration is closed in winter.</p> <h3>Landscape Features</h3> <p><strong>To the North</strong><br /> Bryce Point is famous for its view to the north, across the full length of the Bryce Amphitheater. Inspiration, Sunset, and Sunrise Points can all be seen along the forested edge of the Paunsagunt plateau. Famous geologic features visible from here include the Wall of Windows near Inspiration Point, dense rows of hoodoos (irregularly eroded spires of rock) forming Silent City beside Sunset Point, and the flat top of Boat Mesa seen north of Sunrise Point. The caprock of Boat Mesa, known as the conglomerate at Boat Mesa, is the same layer you stand on now. It\u00a0comprises the large boulders that have fallen just shortly below the view. This conglomerate layer is a result of a time after the fresh water lakes that deposited the colorful rocks below retreated when this area began to be uplifted by volcanic activity and eroded by streams. Evidence of massive volcanic activity that was occurring around 20 million years ago is seen in the Black Mountains further north\u00a0and the Tushar Mountains seen even further off to the Northwest.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the East</strong><br /> The town of Tropic can be seen in the Paria Valley nearly 3,000 feet (914 m) below. The horizon is graced with the grandeur of the Table Cliffs or Aquarius Plateau, whose notched southern end (known as Powell Point) stands 13 miles (21 km) distant. Tracing the horizon south, the next prominence is Canaan Peak, which is also crested with the colorful Claron Formation. From here, the Kaiparowits Plateau forms the horizon until it meets with Navajo Mountain, approximately 80 miles (129 km) distant and visible on clear days.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the South</strong><br /> Views to the south are partially obscured by the plateau's edge, which forms the southern end of the Bryce Amphitheater area here. Below the point, the Peekaboo Loop can be seen descending north through an engineered hole in the rock.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the West</strong><br /> Large cavities in the white limestone layer of the Claron formation are known as the Grottos. This white layer is formed of especially soluble limestone, and groundwater working its way from above and then laterally through this layer. Above and below the Grottos, less soluble rock limits the formation of similar features. The Wall of Windows extends as a fin from this area, essentially a continuous aspect of these features that has now been exposed on both sides and therefore erodes more quickly through frost-wedging, wind, and other weathering forces. Above the Grottos, a forest of moisture-loving Douglas Fir grows and can be enjoyed along the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the Rim Trail connecting Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Note this section is closed in winter due to narrow trails and snow cornices.</p>",

Roosevelt as a task force to work on a wide variety of conservation and public works projects, the CCC's objective was primarily unemployment relief. It provided work for a total of 3 million people--mostly young men during its existence. Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work.

It can be begun from either the Tower Bridge Trailhead or further notice at Fairyland Point (not accessible by vehicle\u00a0in winter months). Spending 2.5 miles (4 km) along quiet ponderosa forests on the\u00a0Rim Trail and the rest below surrounded by hoodoos within\u00a0Fairyland and Campbell Canyons, it provides an excellent experience of the diversity above and below the rim. The trail can be hiked either clockwise or counter-clockwise, though many prefer the latter for the opportunity to descend rather than climb the Tower Bridge Trail section.<br /> Generally the trail traces a large circle centered on Boat Mesa, the large flat-topped feature capped with the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. This rock layer is one of the park's youngest, from a time after the freshwater lakes\u00a0that would deposit the vibrant Claron Formation that forms the park's hoodoos had drained away, leaving large braided rivers that drained mountains to the north.\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fairylandloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>The Rim Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Varies (Easy to Moderate)<br /> Total Distance: 5.5\u00a0miles (8.9\u00a0km)<br /> Ascent/Descent (North to South): 1,825 feet (556 m) / 1,330\u00a0feet (405\u00a0m)<br /> Average time: 3-4 hours</strong><br /> <br /> The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail\u00a0begins in the south at Bryce Point and ends in the north at Fairyland Point. The trail connects all viewpoints in the Bryce Amphitheater area and can be accessed at each of them.<br /> The section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is paved and has minor elevation changes; this portion\u00a0is wheelchair accessible except in severe weather.<br /> This section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is also\u00a0the only section of the Rim Trail pets are allowed on; all pets must be on leash and owners must pick up after them. The section from Bryce to Inspiration is closed in winter.<br /> During shuttle season, hikers may use stops here, at Inspiration, Sunset, and Sunrise to complete one-way hikes. Fairyland Point has no shuttle service.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p><strong>Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p>",

The hoodoos (irregularly eroded rock spires) that fill Fairyland Canyon are younger than those further to the south in the main Bryce Amphitheater, and will be developed more fully as the erosional processes associated with the Paria River to the east continue to wear away the land in a north and westward direction. By contrast, immediately to the south is Campbell Canyon, where you can hike through a \"hoodoo graveyard.\" In this region, all the hoodoos have eroded away leaving multicolored clay mounds, which like tombstones, mark their passing. Campbell Canyon can\u00a0be reached by hiking the Fairyland Loop or Tower Bridge Trail, or overlooked along the Rim Trail.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail connects this view to Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points to the south. The most popular section is the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section between Sunrise and Sunset\u00a0Points; this section is paved (and therefore permits leashed pets) and has minimal elevation changes. The Fairyland\u00a0Loop Trail also descends from this viewpoint area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Travelling down the trail into Fairyland Canyon a short way will provide views to the northern end of the park, where erosion of the Paunsagunt Plateau associated with the Paria River to the east has been occurring for less time than areas of the park to the south. The area you are looking upon is the northern end of the Paria Valley.<br /> Thrust faulting associated with the volcanic activity that also created the Black Mountains far to the north around 20 million years ago has created diagonal cracks within hoodoos here; if you look closely you may notice some hoodoos with older, Cretaceous-era rocks associated with the Grey Cliffs pushed up on top of hoodoos formed from the Eocene-era Claron Formation or Pink Cliffs. Driving along Highway 12 towards Mossy Cave provides a closer view of the smooth slickenslide surfaces created by these thrust faults.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Below the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, the valley of the Paria river exposes marine shales of the Grey Cliffs. At the point where these two rock types meet, Sinking Ship stands at about 30 degrees, tilted up by the faultline that runs along the eastern edge of the park. This fault, known as the Paunsagunt fault, was created over the last 20 million years by forces associated first with the uplift of this Colorado Plateau region, and later with the extension of Basin and Range faulting to the west in Nevada and California. This fault is a normal fault--bringing the eastern edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau down and away from rocks to the east and to the level of the softer marine Grey Cliffs that form the valley floor in this area. This arrangement is largely responsible for the creation of the amphitheaters along the edge of the plateau, as seasonal streams that run to the Paria River have formed within the Pink Cliffs, rather than far below them. To see what that arrangement would look like, look further east to the colorful Table Cliff plateau standing at 10,000 ft (3048 m) along the opposite side of the valley. This is the same rock layer seen within the park, however it remains at a height unaffected by the movement of the Paunsagunt fault.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The Paunsagunt Plateau begins to level off in this area, with ponderosa forests found along hills surrounded by meadows of grass and sage. Look for wildlife like pronghorn and mule deer within these meadows. Mountain lions have also been seen, though it's extremely rare.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>To the south is the feature known as Boat Mesa. It capped with a resistant rock called the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. These conglomerated pebbles and rocks formed in the period after the freshwater lakes that deposited the iron-rich Claron formation that forms the hoodoos below were replaced by large streams carrying water from volcanic mountains building to the north. Boat Mesa rises above the hoodoos of Fairyland Canyon to an elevation of 8073 feet. Beyond it is Campbell Canyon, and beyond that is the Bryce Amphitheater.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Farview Point is appropriately named. Navajo Mountain, 90 miles away on the border of Utah and Arizona, can be seen on all but the worst days. To the east, beyond the Table Cliff plateau, you may be able to see the more pointed peaks of the Henry Mountains, 84 miles away. These magnificent views result from Bryce Canyon's extremely high air quality. While many visitors are awed by the beautiful things they see here, it is what they don't see (the haze and smog produced by particulates in the air) that is one of Bryce Canyon's most valued assets.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A very short (.15 mi / .24 km) and flat but unpaved trail leads north from the parking lot to Piracy Point.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>See the hoodoos eroded from the edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau. From this point along the plateau you can begin to see the Rainbow Point amphitheater. A forest floor of pine and fir lies 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Following the horizon line from the Table Cliff plateau's southernmost tip (known as Powell Point), Canaan Peak is the next prominence to the south. It too is capped with the Claron formation. Further along, the horizon line reveals the top of the Kaiparowits plateau, composed of transitional Cretaceous sandstones of the Grey Cliffs. Down in the valley, the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs are largely obscured by the pinyon pine and juniper forests that grow readily upon them. Lower down, the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone. Beyond these are deep canyons carved into the sandstones of the White Cliffs, which are also beautifully exposed at Zion National Park further west. Note the feature known as \"Molly's Nipple\", which appears like a conical mountain among the White Cliffs. This is not a dormant volcano, but instead an area capped with a more erosion-resistant form of sandstone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest the Tushar Mountains, and atop the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north the Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau. This elevation is the transitional zone between Ponderosa Pine Forests and\u00a0Mixed Conifer\u00a0forest. Watch for representatives of both plant and animal communities. Here you might find flowers such as Showy Goldeneye and Shrubby Cinquefoil. Also watch for Osprey. If you are surprised to find fish eaters like Osprey living in a desert-like environment you're not the only one. Not too far from here nest a pair of Osprey that catch and carry fish from Tropic Reservoir - a distance of two air miles!</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h4>California Condors</h4> <p>With a wingspan of 9 to 10 feet, the California condor is the largest land bird in North America. 10,000 years ago, its range was similarly broad--stretching across most of the continent. Much later, as European settlers began to arrive on this continent, you would've found them throughout the west, nesting in cliffs as far south as Baja California, as far north as British Columbia, and in cliffs like those below you. But by 1940, lead bullet poisoning of carrion they fed upon, poaching, DDT contamination, and habitat destruction all led to a collapse of their range to just the coastal mountains of southern California. By 1982 only 23 of these birds survived, and by 1987 all remaining wild condors were relocated into captive breeding programs.<br /> <br /> Captive breeding programs have been successful so far in saving this impressive bird from extinction--in Zion National Park, chick #1,000 was reared in the wild in 2019. Today there are currently almost 100 condors flying free today in northern Arizona and southern Utah thanks to the Southwest Condor Working Group and the actions of hunters voluntarily participating in lead ammunition reduction programs.<br /> <br /> In July of 1999, two condors wearing tags 82 and 93 (large numbers affixed to bird wings for identification and tracking) were spotted perched at overlooks along the southern end of this park. Since then, sightings have been exceedingly rare if they've happened at all. That said, these birds can travel well over 100 miles a day in search of food, so as populations in areas like Zion and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument continue to grow, the chances of seeing one here at Bryce get better and better.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/nature/californiacondor.htm\">Read more online</a></p>",

In July 1999, two condors were spotted in the park. Sightings are rare and impossible to predict, but perhaps one day California condors will nest on these rugged cliffs.<br /> <br /> Female condors lay one egg every other year. Both parents incubate the egg and care for their offspring. A chick fledges (flies) by six months, but may stay with its parents for 1-2 years.

As World War II ended in 1945, the nation's love of automobile travel begin to outcompete the model of railroad and bus-facilitated tourism that the UPC had been providing in the park since the early 1920s. This change in transportation methods paralleled an increase in visitation. While in 1924, visitation totalled 17,213 people, by 1948 that number had increased to 175,975. Between 1946 and 1949 only 3.28 percent of the park's annual visitation visited the park as UPC passengers. To try and meet the increased demand of these visitors and their automobiles, the Service Station was constructed to provide fuel and full service facilities--paralleling developments in other western parks.<br /> <br /> Although the building was designed by architects under contract to the UPC, the National Park Service (NPS) approved the design. In this period, some NPS architects rejected the \"exaggerated\" rustic style of the 1920s, 30s, and early 40s in favor of building that reflected simpler, contemporary design principles. For this particular building, form defines function. The station is significant as an example of \"roadside architecture\". This style is a distinctly American contribution to the built environment, indicative of a period of service station construction during which buildings were designed to accomodate a full range of services including mechanical repairs. The irregularly shaped, one-story building rests on a concrete foundation. The west elevation, curved wall is constructed of rough cut, regularly coursed stone from a local quarry.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The Service Station closed in 1988, but is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Future uses for the building are currently being considered.</p> <h2>The Utah Parks Company at Bryce Canyon</h2> <p>The Utah Parks Company\u00a0(UPC) was a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, which owned and operated restaurants, lodging, and bus tours in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument from the 1920s until 1972. Before Bryce Canyon became a national park, the Union Pacific Railroad had conceived these parks and monuments as forming\u00a0a \"Grand Circle\", which would ultimately be visited first by arrival at a rail depot in Lund, Utah (near present day Cedar City) and then by bus to the UPC-owned El Escalante hotel in Cedar City, and then to the parks themselves. To accomodate these visitors, the Utah Parks Company financed the construction of the Bryce Canyon Lodge, numerous cabins and other less permanent accomodations, as well as the Historic Service Station. After the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park in 1928, UPC would serve as the park's sole concessionaire until competition from private motor vehicles and other operating costs would lead to their liquidiation and donation of all assets within the park to the National Park Service in 1972.<br /> \u00a0</p>",

The viewpoint here consists of three levels that provide varied spectacular perspectives in all directions. The Claron Formation consists of two members, the lower Pink Member, a \"dirty\" limestone that contains sand, silt, and iron that lends the rock its reddish color, and the upper White Member, a purer freshwater limestone. This upper White Member of the Claron Formation is visible below Inspiration Point, although few hoodoos form in this softer rock.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail begins in the south at Bryce Point. From Inspiration Point it is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to Bryce Point. Note this section is closed in Winter. To the north it is 0.7 miles (1.2 km) to Sunset Point. It is 1.2 miles (2.0 km) to Sunrise Point. The section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is paved and has minor elevation changes. The path is wheelchair accessible except in severe weather. This is the only section of the Rim Trail pets are allowed on; all pets must be on leash and owners must pick up after them. It is 3.8 miles (6.1 km) to Fairyland Point. <strong>During shuttle season, hikers may use stops here, at Bryce, Sunset, and Sunrise to complete one-way hikes. Fairyland Point has no shuttle service.</strong></p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>The view to the north looks along the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau. Dense rows of rock walls known as the Silent City are seen just south of Sunset Point. Following the plateau rim, Sunrise Point tilts upward. Beyond this the head of Campbell Canyon and the flat-topped feature of Boat Mesa. From upper views, one can see beyond the plateau's ponderosa forest and overlook its meadows. Evidence of massive volcanic activity approximately 20 million years ago is seen in the Black Mountains further north atop the plateau and the Tushar Mountains seen even further off to the Northwest.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Inspiration Point looks down upon Bryce Creek, the main drainage of the Bryce Amphitheater. It is typically a dry wash, only flowing with water during summer rain or melting winter snow. It exits the amphitheater to the right of Bristlecone Point and the left of an unnamed promontory. Both Bristlecone Point and Sinking Ship to its left reveal a tilt associated with the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault line, which displaced this plateau 2,000 feet (610 m) lower than rocks east of these features. This brought the park's limestone layers to be even with soft marine shales seen in the Grey Cliffs that form the basin of the Paria Valley. It also explains the difference in elevation between the colorful Table Cliffs across the valley 13 miles (21 km) distant and the Bryce Amphitheater. Tracing the horizon south, the next prominence is Canaan Peak, which is also crested with the colorful Claron Formation. From here, the Kaiparowits Plateau forms the horizon until it meets with Navajo Mountain, approximately 80 miles (129 km) distant and visible on clear days.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>Views to the south are best appreciated from the uppermost viewpoint. Here one looks toward Bryce Point with the Wall of Windows extending out below. Views from below are possible along the Peekaboo Loop trail, which can be seen emerging from a feature known as the Cathedral below. A forest of moisture-loving Douglas Fir grows and can be enjoyed along the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the Rim Trail connecting Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Note this section is closed in winter due to narrow trails and snow cornices.</p>",

Bryce Canyon has the greatest concentration of hoodoos on Earth.<br /> <br /> Currently the climate here provides a perfect balance of freezing and thawing temperatures to create hoodoos. As global temperatures rise, less frequent freeze/thaw cycles may occur, creating more rounded hoodoos shaped more by rain and chemical weathering than ice.</p>",

It is also the northernmost hike in the park, located just off of SR 12 as it winds its way through the park boundary.",
    "bodyText": "<p>Mossy Cave is in the northern section of the park, located on Highway 12, approximately 4 miles east of the intersection of Highways 12 and 63. Look for a small parking area on the right-hand side immediately after crossing a little bridge. The Mossy Cave itself is at the end of a short trail. Here too you can see hoodoos and windows without having to hike a steep trail.</p> <p>At first, this canyon known as Water Canyon, might look like any ordinary Bryce Canyon kind of canyon. It's not. From 1890-1892 mormon pioneers labored with picks and shovels to carve an irrigation ditch from the East Fork of the Sevier River, through the Paunsaugunt Plateau, into this canyon.</p> <p>Every year since its completion in 1892 (except during the drought of 2002), this canal known as the Tropic Ditch has supplied the communities of Tropic and Cannonville with irrigation water.</p> <h4><strong>Geology</strong></h4> <p>By definition Bryce Canyon is misnamed, it is not a real \"canyon\". Canyons are carved by flowing water. Most of the \"canyons\" of Bryce are carved by ice forming in cracks - a process known as frost wedging. Even though the Tropic Ditch has been flowing for only a century it has changed the geology of Water Canyon. As you hike up the Mossy Cave Trail, notice how the higher elevations of this \"canyon\" have the lumpy, broken, and random texture typical of Bryce Canyon and its hoodoos. You will also see how the lower section is without hoodoos, and has smooth angled sides looking like a 'V' in cross-section. Because of this little water course, it is unlikely that hoodoos will form here. The existing ones will eventually crumble and Water Canyon will have completed its metamorphosis into a \"real canyon.\"</p> <h4><strong>Nature</strong></h4> <p>The presence of water alone is what makes Water Canyon unique. Although you might not see them (animals tend to avoid busy trails - especially in daylight hours), a wide diversity of animals come here regularly to quench their thirst. The supply of water is still recent enough that nature hasn't quite caught up yet. Eventually more riparian trees like willows and cottonwoods will probably grow here. In the meantime you'll be surprised to see some plants that you might expect to find along a brook in a mountain meadow, such as Mountain Death Camas and Watson Bog Orchid.</p> <h4><strong>Trails</strong></h4> <p>Visit the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mossy-cave-trail.htm\">Mossy Cave Trail</a>\u00a0page for more information.</p>",

The impressive feature seen here is instead a natural arch, or window, formed primarily by the expansion of ice in cracks deep within. A more weathering-resistant layer of rock protects the softer rocks below from more rapid erosion, while ice, rain, and wind slowly open the arch wider and wider.<br /> As the edge of the plateau has eroded back, a small gully has formed that flows with rain and melting snow (now more than 125 feet below the arch).

Within this amphitheater, Natural Bridge is being formed by the same process as all hoodoos: walls or fins are formed by the presence of harder, more erosion resistant cap layers as the plateau rim erodes backwards through the action of rain and melting snow. Windows then form as rain and melting snow trickle into cracks within these fins. Overnight freezing temperatures cause this water to expand as it turns to ice, breaking the rock apart from within and creating windows--of which Natural Bridge is a very large example. Eventually, the caprock will collapse, leaving behind rock spires on either side of the window known as \"hoodoos\".</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>View the eroded and forested edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p>",

Yellow Creek's erosion of the Grey Cliffs' softer marine layers directly below you currently undercuts the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, resulting in large slabs falling away at once. The sheer cliffs created by this undercutting characterize almost all viewpoints south of here.\u00a0The southern end of the Paria Valley is easier seen here at at viewpoints further south than from the Bryce Amphitheater, and distant views of the dramatic White Cliffs and the dome of Navajo Mountain are wonderful at sunset.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A short paved path leads to a promontory viewpoint. No other trails depart from this area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>The headwaters of Yellow Creek have been at work for millions of years, slowly pushing back into the Paunsaugunt plateau and carving the deep amphitheater below you. Due to softer marine layers of rock below the iron-rich Claron formation's limestone cliffs, these rocks are being undercut and sheer away rather than slope in the ways seen within the Bryce Amphitheater to the north. Yellow Creek drains into the Paria River, and the Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view beyond this amphitheater. Observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs (Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone) which then transition into the less iron-rich white sandstones and deep canyons carved within the Navajo Formation further off. Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p>",

The trail takes its name from the surprises that await around its many turns and elevation changes. In summer, these surprises may include horse and mule riders, which is why a clockwise direction of travel is recommended. This direction also provides for the best views of the Wall of Windows, one of the most iconic features along this strenuous trail. Hikers may choose to connect to either the Queen's Garden or Navajo Loop trails at the loop's northern junction. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/peekabooloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Hat Shop Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 4 miles (6.4 km)<br /> Elevation Change: 1,436 feet (428 m)<br /> Average Time: 3-4 hours</strong><br /> <br /> The Hat Shop Trail offers long views overlooking the colorful cliffs of the Grand Staircase to the south and a quiet solitude in which to enjoy them. Hikers descend nearly 1500 feet (457 meters) as they travel the first 2 miles (3.2 km) of the much longer 23 mile (37 km) Under-the-Rim backcountry Trail before turning around to climb 2 miles (3.2 km) back. At the turnaround point, balanced-rock hoodoos cluster along the trail's edge. These narrow, orange pinnacles wear \"hats\" of large grey boulders, giving them a distinct appearance compared to hoodoos seen in the Bryce Amphitheater to the north.

    "bodyText": "<p>Piracy Point has been said to take its name from the buttes that might resemble pirate ships sailing alongside the rim, but it's more likely that the name refers to a geomorphological process that is soon to take place here. This point overlooks Swamp Canyon and the Sheep Creek drainage system to the north and the Willis Creek drainage system that collects run-off south from here. The broad, sloping valley to the north of you currently drains to Sheep Creek, but on the other side of the cliffs right of it, tributaries of Willis Creek are steadily encroaching. Someday soon, the Willis Creek drainage will begin to divert water through a process called \"stream piracy\". This is when a river drainage system or watershed is diverted from its own bed, and flows instead down the bed of a neighboring stream. Swamp Canyon is also one of the only places in the park where water flowing on top of the plateau is diverted over the rim to the east (rather than travelling west as part of the Sevier River).<br /> <br /> This is also the transitional zone between Ponderosa Pine Forests and the Spruce-Fir forest. Watch for representatives of both plant and animal communities. Here you might find flowers such as Showy Goldeneye and Shrubby Cinquefoil. Also watch for Osprey. If you are surprised to find fish eaters like Osprey living in a desert-like environment you're not the only one.

    "bodyText": "<p>Ponderosa Canyon is so named because of the huge Ponderosa Pines on the canyon floor. Some of these trees measure more than 5 ft. in diameter and exceed heights of 150 ft. However from high above at the viewpoint you would never know this. In fact many are confused by the name, not expecting to find themselves surrounded by a forest of Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir. Certain types of vegetation grow in certain environments according to conditions such as moisture and temperature. These conditions are strongly controlled by elevation. Forests, therefore, are divided into zones or forest types according to elevation, because a forest's dominant tree species varies with these changes in elevation.<br /> <br /> Bryce Canyon National Park encompasses three of these forest types from the lowest elevations below the rim of the canyon to the upper elevations in the southernmost end of the park. At the bottom is the Pinyon-Juniper Woodland Belt, dominated by the Pinyon Pine and the Utah Juniper. The rim of the canyon in the northern end of the park is dominated by the Ponderosa Pine, and is thus classified as the Ponderosa Pine Forest. At the highest elevations, like here at Ponderosa Point, Engelmann Spruce, Douglas-fir and White Fir are the most common tree species, indicative of a Mixed Conifer Forest.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Trail Closed due to Rockfall</span></strong><br /> From here, the Agua Connector Trail descends 1.6 miles (4.0 km) to its junction with the Under the Rim Trail approximately 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>See the hoodoos eroded from the edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau contained within a bowl-shaped amphitheater shared with Rainbow Point. A forest floor of pine and fir lies 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Below these Pink Cliffs, observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center.\u00a0<a href=\"https://nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h4>Permits Required</h4> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry.

They erected tents and supplied meals for guests near Sunset Point, and in 1920 constructed Tourists' Rest, a lodge with tent cabins. When Bryce Canyon became a national monument in 1923, the Union Pacific Railroad purchased Tourists' Rest to construct the park's now historic lodge and cabins. The Syrett's visitor accommodations were relocated just north of the park, and Ruby's Inn serves visitors to this day.",

The varied and colorful rock formations that surround this hoodoo, are described as many sculptures and other ornaments within the\u00a0Queen's \"Garden\".\u00a0Of the six\u00a0trails that descend into the Bryce Amphitheater, the Queen's Garden Trail is considered the least strenuous; though due to the park's high elevation and steep grades in some areas,\u00a0it is still categorized as a moderately strenuous hike (other Bryce Amphitheater trails include the Tower Bridge Trail, Navajo Loop Trail, Fairyland Loop Trail, Tower Bridge Trail, and Peekaboo Loop Trail). The trail also provides views of a grove of bristlecone pines near the Horse Trail junction.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/queensgarden.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Combination Loops</h2> <p>This trail can be combined with the Navajo Loop to form the 2.9 mile\u00a0(4.6 km) <strong>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</strong> and the Peekaboo Loop to form the 6.4 mile (10.2 km) <strong>Figure-8 Combination Loop</strong>.</p> <h3>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Moderate<br /> Total Distance: 2.9\u00a0miles (4.6\u00a0km)<br /> Elevation change: 600\u00a0feet (138\u00a0m)<br /> Average time: 2-3 hours</strong><br /> Perhaps the park's most popular and iconic trail, the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop can begin at either Sunrise or Sunset Point but is recommended in a clockwise direction; this is done by descending on the Queen's Garden Trail and ascending the Navajo Loop Trail (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use and iconic views of Thor's Hammer; Wall Street side is only open in summer). Whether one begins at Sunset or Sunrise Point, these two viewpoints\u00a0are connected by a flat, 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that completes the loop. If one begins at Sunset Point, they should begin by hiking this section of the Rim Trail to Sunrise Point.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/qgnavajocombo.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Figure-8\u00a0Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 6.4\u00a0miles (10.2\u00a0km)<br /> Elevation change: 320 feet (98\u00a0m)<br /> Average time: 4-5 hours</strong><br /> The Figure-8 Combination combines the Peekaboo Loop Trail with the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop to create a 6.4 mile (10.2 km) combination of two loops. Like the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop, the Peekaboo Loop should be hiked in a clockwise direction. One can begin at either Sunset or Sunrise Point. From Sunset Point, one would begin by first hiking the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that leads north to Sunrise Point, then descend the Queen's Garden Trail to its intersection with the Navajo Loop. A short connecting trail leads from here across Bryce Creek to the Peekaboo Loop Trail. Keeping left will take hikers in a clockwise direction around the strenuous Peekaboo\u00a0Loop and return them to the intersection of Navajo and Queen's Garden Trails. From here hikers ascend back up to Sunset Point (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use; Wall Street only open in summer).</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p><strong>Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p>",

Tectonic uplift has lifted this entire scene from sea-level over the course of the last 20 million years to later be dissected by tributaries of the Paria and Colorado Rivers. Tilting that occurred during uplift has situated the southern end of the park approximately 1,000 ft (304 m) higher than its northern end near the Visitor Center. Here erosion has been at work far longer than the Bryce Amphitheater, and undercut sheer cliffs compose much of the view along the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A short path along the plateau edge leads west to the easy 1.0 mi/1.6 km Bristlecone Loop, as well as the 8.8 mi/14.2 km backcountry Riggs Spring Loop and 23 mi/37 km Under-the-Rim Trail.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>View the eroded edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters, which drain to the Paria River and then the Colorado River. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest and the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north, the Tushar Mountains and Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Below the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, the valley of the Paria river exposes marine shales of the Grey Cliffs and further south, sandstones of the White Cliffs. The Pink Cliffs as seen in the Table Cliff Plateau can be seen rising to 10,000 ft (3048 m) along the opposite side of the valley.</p> <h4>to the West</h4> <p>Across the Paunsagunt Plateau, peaks of the Black Mountains, and further off the Tushar mountains can be seen. Water which falls upon the forested top of this plateau drains not to the Colorado River, but west and north along the Sevier River towards Nevada. The edge of the plateau is therefore a watershed between the Colorado River and the Great Basin desert of Nevada.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>Views to the south can be best appreciated across the parking lot at Yovimpa Point or along the Bristlecone Loop Trail.</p>",

Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work. Notable projects included the Under-the-Rim Trail from Rainbow Point to Bryce Point, structures at Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail gazebo, and front-country campground development.

Gain a new perspective of the Grand Staircase by descending to its next stair--the Cretaceous sandstones of the Grey Cliffs. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h4>Camping (Permits Available at Visitor Center)</h4> <p>There are 4 campsites on the 8.8 mile (14.2 km) Riggs Spring Loop Trail, which also can be accessed from here. You must obtain a permit to use these sites.</p> <h4>Under-the-Rim Trail</h4> <p>Access the Under-the-Rim Trail by following signs for the Bristlecone Loop Trail east toward Rainbow Point.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center.\u00a0<a href=\"https://nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

    "title": "Solar Voltaic Arrays",
    "listingDescription": "",
    "bodyText": "<h3>How it Works</h3> <p>The Bryce Canyon Solar Array consists of two dual-axis trackers that perfectly follow our Sun throughout each day during every season of the year. Such telescope-like precision is required because unlike regular photovoltaic panels, Concentrating PhotoVoltaic (CPV) technology does not generate electricity from ambient light. For the Fresnel lens to concentrate sunlight and for the tiny triple-junction chips to convert it to electricity, the sun alignment has to be within 1-2 degrees.\u00a0<br /> <br /> When installed in sunny locations, CPV outperforms all other kinds of solar energy, both in sunlight conversion efficiency and energy density (kilowatts / acre). \u00a0Operating at 140kW per hour and peaking at 150kW, this array generates more energy than can be easily stored in batteries, so instead, excess energy is returned to the grid. \u00a0On a sunny day, the array generates more than twice the energy the Bryce Canyon Visitor Center uses, providing us with an energy credit that can then be reclaimed at night or on cloudy days.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h3>The Photovoltaic Cell</h3> <p>Each tracker consists of 5,040 individual solar collection cells. \u00a0Sunlight enters each cell through a Fresnel lens, (commonly used in lighthouses to focus light into a beam) which concentrates sunlight through a reflecting chamber on to a tiny triple junction photovoltaic chip.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Because all photovoltaics perform better at cooler temperatures, the chip itself is mounted on a large aluminum heat-sink (similar to those used to cool computer processors) with blades that extend out of the cell, on the shaded size of the unit, where air circulation aids in further\u00a0</p> <h3>Maximizing Solar Energy</h3> <p>Only half of our Sun\u2019s energy reaches Earth\u2019s surface. The narrow range known as optical light is what the human eye-brain combination uses. Through photosynthesis, plants convert 2-4% of solar energy into sugars. The best silicon solar panels are about 18% efficient. Concentrating PhotoVoltaics (CPV) technology focuses light onto triple-stacked photocells of different alloys. Each layer in the stack collects sunlight from a different part of the spectrum, that when added together, converts 34% of our Sun\u2019s transmitted energy into electricity.</p> <h3>Other Facts</h3> <ul> <li> <p>When wind speeds exceed 35 mph, each tracker\u2019s anemometer instructs it to tilt back to the horizontal wind stow position where they can survive winds speeds up to 100 mph.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>A clock drive allows the trackers to track our Sun even when cloudy. A sun-tracker in the upper center of each tracker adds precision when our Sun is out.</p> </li> <li> <p>A pyrheliometer independently measures sunlight intensity and our Sun\u2019s precise position in the sky to improve efficiency.</p> </li> </ul>",

Though this point along with Sunset Point was named to entice early Lodge visitors to easily accessible points along the rim at both times of day, this view is equally spectacular at daybreak and day's end. At an elevation of 8,100 feet (2,469 m), Sunrise Point is\u00a0just slightly higher than the Rim Trail and the ponderosa forest to the west.\u00a0This provides one with a 360 degree view, making it a great choice for stargazers, and those hoping to see the sun's final light along the western horizon. The view of the rock formations (hoodoos) within the Bryce Amphitheater is exceptional as well. Here one can clearly see the full process of hoodoo formation as the plateau rim erodes back exposing walls or fins of layered rock, which are\u00a0then broken by frost-wedging with windows (arches) that expand to eventually form the isolated columns of stone known as hoodoos. Further east, the eye traces to see these hoodoos' final state: colorful badlands of sediment spotted with vegetation, including bristlecone pines. The popular Queen's Garden trail provides an unforgettable journey down a ridgeline that provides views of every stage of\u00a0this\u00a0process.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail connects this view to Sunrise and Fairyland Points further north and Inspiration and Bryce Points further south. The most popular section is the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section between here and Sunrise Point. This section is paved (and therefore permits leashed pets) and has minimal elevation changes. The Queen's Garden Trail also descends from this viewpoint area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Northeast</h4> <p>See the flat-topped feature of\u00a0Boat Mesa and the angled slope of Sinking Ship set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau 17.5\u00a0miles (28\u00a0km) distant. The roughly 30 degree slope of Sinking Ship is evidence of the Paunsaugunt fault line, which travels north-south roughly along the eastern edge of the park. This fault, along with large fields of volcanic rock north of the park, were\u00a0created as part of the tectonic events that elevated the Colorado Plateau region\u00a0to its present day elevations and later produced the Basin and Range region to the west. The fault is a normal fault, which means that it was formed by extension--the ground you're standing upon moving down and away from the opposite side of the valley. This movement accounts for the 2,000 foot (610 m) difference in elevation between the Bryce Amphitheater and the Table Cliff plateau, despite these being formed of the same rock layer. Sinking Ship is slightly caught upon this fault, explaining its tilted appearance. Though once a site of intense movement, little activity has been recorded along the fault in the last 9 million years.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The large crown-shaped feature in the middle of the Bryce Amphitheater is known as Bristlecone Point. If you have some binoculars, you may be able to see their scraggly forms upon the white layers of the Claron formation capping Bristlecone Point. You can see that between here and Bristlecone Point is a series of colorful badlands that continue to the north, but steeply drop off into more forested areas to the south. One can see this as a north/south dividing line within the Bryce Amphitheater, where areas south have been eroded more deeply and undercut cliffs to the south (a trend that increases the further south in the park you travel), while erosion has been gentler and less dramatic further north. Beyond Bristlecone Point is the broad Paria Valley, which has been formed over the last 6 million years by the Paria River. The Paria River ultimately joins the Colorado River not too far from Navajo Mountain, visible on the southeastern horizon.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>To the south, one can also see Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points along the forested rim of the Paunsagunt Plateau. If you have an especially good eye (and know what you're looking for) you can spot Thor's Hammer along the Two Bridges side of the Navajo Loop below Sunset Point.</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <p>The Limber Pine at Sunrise Point (known as \"Stilts\"), roots exposed by erosion of the rim, serves as a reminder of the resilience and ability of life to adapt to adverse conditions, and also of the rapidity with which the scene before us is disappearing. Geologists have calculated that the rim of the canyon is eroding at a rate of one\u00a0to four feet every century and that in approximately three million years, Bryce Canyon will be gone forever. The hoodoos of Bryce Canyon's main amphitheater appear as a snapshot in the rapid process of erosion on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. This rapidly eroding land creates a harsh environment for any living thing, and like this limber pine, all creatures which live here, from people to animals to plants, must adapt to the conditions in order to survive.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Swamp Canyon begins a transition from the hoodoo-filled Bryce Amphitheater to the steep cliffs and buttes that characterize the scenic drive and southern end of the park.\u00a0Many people assume that Swamp Canyon must be a misnomer. Although it might be the last place on Earth you would expect to find an alligator, compared to the rest of the park it is a virtual wetland. Here, below the rim, two tiny creeks and a spring provide enough water to sustain more lush vegetation like grasses and willows. This canyon remains wet enough year-around that it is also home to tiger salamanders and wild iris. Bird watchers enjoy hiking the Swamp Canyon Loop Trail as it traverses four distinctly different habitats offering the chance to see a wide diversity of songbirds.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The moderately strenuous 4.0 mi/6.4 km Swamp Canyon Loop begins at the north end of the parking lot. The trail descends 647 ft/198 m to the canyon floor on a 3 - 4 hour hike. The Swamp Canyon Loop also provides access to the 23 mi/37 km Under-the-Rim Trail.\u00a0See nearby Swamp Canyon Loop Trailhead for more information.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Mud and Noon Canyon Buttes can be seen. Buttes are halfway along the erosional continuum between plateau and pinnacle. Plateaus are large regions of uplifted land. Mesas are isolated portions of plateaus that, although much smaller than plateaus, are still wider than they are tall. As mesas erode they give birth to buttes, which are square shaped, being approximately the same width as they are tall. As buttes erode still further they spawn spires of rocks.<br /> At Bryce, our spires, known as hoodoos, are of a very special variety. The classic way a hoodoo forms begins with a narrow fin of rock that eventually develops holes or windows through the forces of frost wedging. As the windows grow they become arches. Eventually arches become too large to support their roofs. The inevitable collapse of a window leaves behind two broken legs of the arch. At Bryce we call broken arches hoodoos.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Tower Bridge Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Moderate<br /> Total Distance: 3.0\u00a0miles (4.8\u00a0km)<br /> Elevation change: 802\u00a0feet (245\u00a0m)<br /> Average time: 2-3\u00a0hours</strong><br /> Similar in difficulty to the Queen's / Navajo Combination loop, but far less travelled, the Tower Bridge trail provides excellent views of Boat Mesa, Sinking Ship, and other distant features within and outside the Bryce Amphitheater area of the park. The trail begins 0.25 miles (0.4 km) north of Sunrise Point along the Rim Trail and is part of the larger 8 mile (12.9 km) Fairyland Loop. It descends steadily 1.5 miles (2.4 miles) into Campbell Canyon, reaching a 200 yard spur trail that leads to the Tower Bridge hoodoo. Hikers should then turn around\u00a0and ascend back to the rim to complete the hike. Those looking for a strenuous hike can continue on along the Fairyland Loop.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/towerbridge.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Fairyland Loop Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 8.0\u00a0miles (12.9\u00a0km)<br /> Elevation change: 1,716\u00a0feet (523\u00a0m)<br /> Average time: 4-5\u00a0hours</strong><br /> Along the the Peekaboo Loop, the Fairyland Loop provides some of the best strenuous hiking in the park. It can be begun from either the Tower Bridge Trailhead or further notice at Fairyland Point (not accessible by vehicle\u00a0in winter months). Spending 2.5 miles (4 km) along quiet ponderosa forests on the\u00a0Rim Trail and the rest below surrounded by hoodoos within\u00a0Fairyland and Campbell Canyons, it provides an excellent experience of the diversity above and below the rim. The trail can be hiked either clockwise or counter-clockwise, though many prefer the latter for the opportunity to descend rather than climb the Tower Bridge Trail section.<br /> Generally the trail traces a large circle centered on Boat Mesa, the large flat-topped feature capped with the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. This rock layer is one of the park's youngest, from a time after the freshwater lakes\u00a0that would deposit the vibrant Claron Formation that forms the park's hoodoos had drained away, leaving large braided rivers that drained mountains to the north.\u00a0<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fairylandloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p>Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.<br /> Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</p> <h2>I Hiked the Hoodoos</h2> <p>Hiking is great exercise and Bryce Canyon's \"I Hiked the Hoodoos!\" program is not just hiking, it's also a scavenger hunt with a special reward!<br /> <br /> <strong>1.

It was closely monitored for resource benefits in this fire-dependent ecosystem, including re-establishing aspen and ponderosa pine in an area dominated by shade-tolerant white fire. Due to the nature of mixed conifer forest, with dense trees low in the understory, the stand-replacing fire behavior you see was normal and expected.<br /> Hot and dry conditions combined with strong winds contributed to very fast-moving fire behavior, and the the Bridge fire entered the park on July 14th. Ultimately around 3,500 acres (about 50% in the park and 50% on Forest Service land) would burn. The burned area stretches along Whiteman Bench between Swamp Canyon and Farview Point for about 1.5 miles, primarily to the west, and in some places reaches below the rim to the east. This was the largest natural wildfire in the park's history.<br /> 300 firefighters from Utah, Nevada, and Arkansas would cooperate to hold the fire along the main park road. Three helicopters were in use for aerial foam and water drops.<br /> There were no injuries or property damage. On July 14th at 4:30 p.m. approximately 50 vehicles were led down from Rainbow Point and escorted out of the park on the Yovimpa Pass Road--a forest service road that bypassed the fire along the main road. Another 10 RVs and motorcycles unable to travel the forest service road were escorted down the main road when it was safe.<br /> Today, the snags (dead, standing trees) provide important habitat for a variety of species, including woodpeckers, nuthatches, owls, and small mammals who will help to disperse the seeds that will regenerate this forest.<br /> What regrowth can you see from where you stand?</p>",

The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

Tectonic uplift has lifted this entire scene from sea-level over the course of the last 20 million years to later be dissected by tributaries of the Colorado River. Tilting that occurred during uplift has situated the southern end of the park approximately 1,000 ft (304 m) higher than its northern end.

Below you and to either side are beautiful exposures of Bryce Canyon's Pink Cliffs, soft limey mudstones colored by iron-oxide (rust) being shaped into beautiful forms by rain and the power frost-wedging ice. Below them, obscured in part by forest, are the soft marine shales and silts of the Grey Cliffs. Beyond these are deep canyons carved into the sandstones of the White Cliffs, which are also beautifully exposed at Zion National Park further west. Note the feature known as \"Molly's Nipple\", which appears like a conical mountain among the White Cliffs. This is not a dormant volcano, but instead an area capped with a more erosion-resistant form of sandstone. The bottom two steps--the Vermillion Cliffs as well as the Chocolate Cliffs are dificult to discern from this distance. The horizon is the Kaibab Upwarp, which forms the northern rim of Grand Canyon. The five cliffs of the Grand Staircase that extend from this point to the Kaibab Upwarp contain one of the world's most complete sedimentary records of the last 300 million years of life and environment on the planet.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted by tectonic forces, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p>",
