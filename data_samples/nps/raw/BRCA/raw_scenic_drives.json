While the Bryce Amphitheater area is found along its first 3 miles (4.8 km), the next 15 miles (24 km) to the road's end are known as the Southern Scenic Drive.\n\nAlong this section of the main road are 9 scenic overlooks that display a lesser-seen\u00a0beauty of Bryce Canyon. One aspect that makes the Southern Scenic Drive unique is that the park's elevations increase the further south you travel. While the Visitor Center is situated at 7,894 ft (2,406 m), Rainbow and Yovimpa Points exceed 9,000 ft (2,743 m).\u00a0This change in elevation is the result uneven tectonic forces that uplifted this region over the last 20 million years, and creates a dramatic contrast--with exceptionally long views\u00a0and unique features--between the north and south ends of the park.\n\n### Winter Closures\n\nThe high elevations along this section of the main road\u00a0also lead\u00a0to temporary winter closures\u00a0at the Mile 3 gate, so be sure to visit the [Conditions page](https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/conditions.htm) for the latest road status.\n\n### Planning Your Drive\n\nIt takes about 40 minutes to drive to the end of the Southern Scenic Drive from the Visitor Center. It is recommended that you begin by first doing this all the way to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points. After enjoying these viewpoints, those you will have passed along the road can be visited on the way back. This way, everything will be on the right-hand side of the road; much safer than pulling across traffic everytime you want to see a viewpoint. Typically a trip of only driving and viewpoints will take around 2-3 hours.\n\n### Highlights\n\nIt is easy to enjoy all the views along the road, as none of them require much walking to reach. That said, most visitors would likely agree that Rainbow Point, Yovimpa Point, Agua Canyon and Natural Bridge are not to be missed.\n\nAs you drive south and gain elevation, you'll notice the park's forest community changing from ponderosa forest to a mixture of colorful quaking aspen and denser stands of white fir and Douglas-fir.\n\n#### Wildlife\n\nPull-outs and viewpoints along the Southern Scenic Drive also give opportunities for wildlife watching. Species seen further south in the park may include elk, black bears, mule deer, birds associated with mixed-conifer forests (such as Clark's nutcrackers and dusky grouse) and high-elevation cliffs (such as peregine falcons).\n\n### Walks and Hikes\n\nAll the viewpoints along the Southern Scenic Drive are located a very short walk from their parking lots, so no hiking is required to enjoy this trip. That said, very little can be seen from the car, so you will want to walk the short distances to the railings to enjoy the view. There are two popular day hikes located along this drive: the easy Bristlecone Loop at Rainbow and Yovimpa Points (usually takes about an hour to hike) and the Swamp Canyon Loop at Swamp Canyon overlook (often takes 3 to 4 hours).\n\nBackcountry hiking options also exist, with the Under-the-Rim Trail running\u00a0approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from along the Southern Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop. A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center.\u00a0[More information](https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm)\n\nDetails\n\n[Duration\\\\\n\\\\\n2-12 Hours](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-the-southern-scenic-drive.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--0)\n\nDepending on whether you just enjoy the drive and the viewpoints or choose to take a hike along the way, the Southern Scenic Drive can be a relatively short excursion or your whole day.\n\n[Activity\\\\\n\\\\\nScenic Driving](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-the-southern-scenic-drive.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--1)\n\nThis trip provides opportunities to see 9 unique viewpoints along the southern, higher elevation stretches of the main park road. These viewpoints not only overlook unique geologic features, but the grand landscape of the Paria Valley and the Grand Staircase beyond.\n\n[Pets Allowed\\\\\n\\\\\nYes](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-the-southern-scenic-drive.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--3)\n\n- **Pets are permitted** **on all paved surfaces in the park:**\u00a0campgrounds, parking lots, paved roads, paved viewpoint areas, on the paved trail between Sunset Point and Sunrise Point, and on the paved Shared Use Path between the park entrance and Inspiration Point.\n- **Pets are not permitted**\u00a0on unpaved trails or viewpoints, in public buildings or on public transportation vehicles. These regulations also apply to pets that are carried.\n- **Pets must be on a leash at all times**; the leash must be no longer than 6 feet.\n- **Pet owners may not leave pet(s) unattended**\u00a0or tied to an object. Pets may not be left in vehicles while their owners hike. Be aware that idling and generator use is not permitted in park parking lots.\n- **Pets may not make unreasonable noise.**\n- **Pet owners are required to pick-up after their pets**\u00a0(excrement and other solid waste).\n\n[Activity Fee\\\\\n\\\\\nNo](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-the-southern-scenic-drive.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--4)\n\nEntrance fees may apply, see Fees & Passes information.\n\nReservations\n\nNo\n\nSeason\n\nYear Round\n\nTime of Day\n\nAny Time\n\nAccessibility Information\n\nAll viewpoints along the Southern Scenic Drive are paved and provide relatively flat access to the views.

You can enjoy all of the park's major overlooks if you get out of your car and take leisurely strolls out to the edge of the pavement.\n\nUtah's All American Road, Hwy 12, provides access to the Bryce Canyon Area, as it cuts across the northern part of the national park. Hwy 63 drops south from Hwy 12 and runs through the main part of the park, past the visitor center, the campgrounds and all of the park's scenic overlooks.\n\nA convenient free shuttle operates in the park during the summer season. It runs along Hwy 63, with stops at the campgrounds, visitor center and major overlooks. Since parking is limited at the overlooks, people are encouraged to use the shuttle.\n\nMajor Points along Hwy 63 (the main Bryce Canyon Road, in order north to south).\n\nMany visitors do not continue south past Bryce Point, but Hwy 63 continues down into the southern part of the park, to these key areas:\n\n**Swamp Canyon Trailhead:**\n\nThe Swamp Canyon Loop takes hikers down into a canyon where two small creeks and a spring create a wetland with lush vegetation. Wildlife is abundant here.\n\n**Farview Point:**\n\nFrom this vista you can look out over parts of Bryce Canyon, and also famous features in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. From north to south you can see the Aquarius Plateau (Pink Cliffs), the Kaiparowits Plateau (Grey Cliffs), Molly's Nipple (White Cliffs), and parts of the Kaibab Plateau. On most days you can easily see Navajo Mountain.\n\n**Natural Bridge:**\n\nThe structure called Natural Bridge is one of several natural arches found in Bryce Canyon. This one is particularly photogenic; it has been sculpted from some of the reddest rock of the Claron Formation, which is rich in iron oxide minerals. From many vantage points you can frame rich green, Ponderosa pine trees through the arch.\n\n**Agua Canyon:**\n\nThis viewpoint overlooks two prominent hoodoos. The taller of the two is known as \"The Hunter.\" To the right is a smaller hoodoo commonly referred to as the \"Rabbit,\" or alternatively the \"Backpacker.\"\n\n**Ponderosa Canyon:**\n\nThis vista overlooks Ponderosa Canyon, so named because huge Ponderosa pine trees grow on the canyon floor. Some of these trees measure more than 5 feet in diameter and exceed heights of 150 feet. The name is a bit confusing because the viewpoint is surrounded by a forest of Blue Spruce and Douglas-fir trees.\n\n**Rainbow Point:**\n\nFrom this vista you can look north over much of Bryce Canyon National Park. Here you can see the snaking rim of the Pink Cliffs, and many of the park's hoodoo-filled amphitheaters.\n\n**Yovimpa Point:**\n\nThis viewpoint allows visitors to look south and west over Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. It is one of the best spots to see the \"steps\" which give the Grand Staircase its name. The National Park Service provides this explanation: \"The steps are named for the dominant color of rock. You are standing on the top step known as the Pink Cliffs. Directly below you are the Grey Cliffs. As you look into the distance you can see Molly's Nipple, which is part of the White Cliffs. Looking down into distant canyons near the horizon, you can just make out some red rock underneath the White Cliffs. This red rock makes up the Vermilion Cliffs. Hidden from view but directly under the towering Vermilion Cliffs are the comparatively diminutive Chocolate Cliffs. The tree-covered hills that meet the horizon belong to the Kaibab Plateau at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.\"\n\n**Highway 12 Area**\n\nHwy 12 cuts across the scenic NE portion of the of Bryce Canyon National Park. One pullout in particular allows visitors to stroll up the easy Mossy Cave Trail to get close to hoodoos set against a lush green forest. Located up the left fork of the trail is Mossy Cave itself. This is a spectacular rock overhang fed by an underground spring. In summer the cave is cool, with water dripping from hanging gardens. During winter the cave is filled with giant icicles.\n\nNear Mossy Cave you will also find a waterfall, which lies just off the right fork of the trail. The waterfall is beautiful and can be reached via a quick and easy walk. There is also a scenic arch up near the top of a red rock formation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Photo gallery: Bryce Canyon Scenic Drives \\| Photo Gallery](https://www.utah.com/things-to-do/scenic-drives/bryce-canyon-scenic-drives/#gallery)\n\n## Bryce Canyon Scenic Drives \\| Photo Gallery\n\n![Bryce Canyon Scenic Drives | Photo Gallery | 0](https://ctfassets.ksldigital.com/0wjmk6wgfops/2bkYweQeMiM44QThYJWvU3/95fed37a6ffc3e61ff95191f018c1d77/f3b26a9442_0b3c4678-cf70-4c5f-a4d0-8065e3fa3227.jpg?w=1280&h=800&fit=fill&f=center&q=80)\n\n## Location\n\n[Get Directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Current+Location/37.57,-112.18)\n\n## Bryce Weather\n\n![Sunny/Wind](https://www.utah.com/build/_assets/sunny-IHYE2HG6.svg)\n\n### Current Weather - Sunny/Wind\n\n19\u00b0F\n\nLow8\u00b0F\n\n* * *\n\nJanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember\n\n### Average Temperature\n\nSun\n\n34.9\u00b0F\n\nLow4.3\u00b0F\n\n### Average Precipitation\n\nRainy weather icon\n\n0.83\"\n\n### Average Snowfall\n\nSnowy weather icon\n\n12.3\"\n\n## Articles\n\n[View Allarrow\\_forward](https://www.utah.com/articles)\n\nnavigate\\_next\n\n[![Naturalist Kid Scavenger Hunt in Bryce Canyon](https://ctfassets.ksldigital.com/0wjmk6wgfops/4yz9v0Oor6tSaPpknCCzRn/3fdb05bc0185be0cf5ad86db9b6decdf/_9c318981-b1cc-4a8e-a219-da89fd9a872c.e678834466.jpg?w=500&h=300&fit=thumb&q=70)](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/naturalist-kid-scavenger-hunt-in-bryce-canyon)\n\n### [Naturalist Kid Scavenger Hunt in Bryce Canyon](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/naturalist-kid-scavenger-hunt-in-bryce-canyon)\n\nBryce Canyon National Park is NOT a canyon.

I'm planning a solo trip to Bryce Canyon, and am wondering about the Scenic Drive itself as a whole. When you're driving, are there any steep drop-offs someone with a fear of heights would have trouble with? I can walk along the overlooks and they don't bother me, but when you're driving and there's sheer drop-offs it's a different story. Hoping you can provide some insight. Thanks in advance\n\nLike\n\n2\n\n\nDislike\n\nReply\n\n![Jordan Outside](https://yt3.ggpht.com/_fqzVRr1jJn1YEMMe9AO5gjTmhLtbujBNwLe8ZdHJEuGeGfCCsGP18MaH7qgcuQEgbunfX992Qc=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\n\n\u00b7\n1 reply\n\n![](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m5evfCF_YxC_lDCZai6PdDPi8RLB_PVhrL3a1ARTLFBM2x9-KClsWFWW2FfUzwIrVBkQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\n\nIs the drive from one viewing point to the next steep and have cliff drops? We only have 2 hrs and therefore thinking if we should just take the park shuttle and and view scenaries esp since we'll be there in july, busy season.\n\nLike\n\n2\n\n\nDislike\n\nReply\n\n![Jordan

that we're looking at is Sunset\n\n1:15\n\n\nPoint so you just follow the road you go\n\n1:18\n\n\nout all of these overlooks are on the Le\n\n1:20\n\n\nhand side of the road and this one it's\n\n1:23\n\n\na oneway um so you park and then you'll\n\n1:25\n\n\nbe able to follow the trail all the way\n\n1:28\n\n\nover and it's paved the whole way

when you get up to\n\n2:36\n\n\nUpper Inspiration Point the view is\n\n2:38\n\n\ndefinitely worth it\n\n2:44\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n3:00\n\n\nso then we hike back down the trail uh\n\n3:03\n\n\nback to the parking lot and then we're\n\n3:05\n\n\non to our next one which is Bryce\n\n3:11\n\n\npoint so Bryce Point has its own parking\n\n3:14\n\n\nlot as\n\n3:17\n\n\nwell you can see that it has its

also has a\n\n5:36\n\n\ntrail that goes to pyy point it's a dirt\n\n5:39\n\n\nTrail it's a pretty short hike um but at\n\n5:41\n\n\nthe end of the uh the trail you'll see\n\n5:43\n\n\npiracy point and

little bit higher\n\n7:22\n\n\nelevation and just amazing views of the\n\n7:24\n\n\nhoodoo\n\n7:36\n\n\nso there were some steps that took us to\n\n7:37\n\n\na trail that you could take back to AA\n\n7:40\n\n\nCanyon um but the trail was closed and\n\n7:43\n\n\nas we uh looked at the bulletin board\n\n7:45\n\n\nthat was just pass this it said warning\n\n7:48\n\n\nbare frequenting area and that's why the\n\n7:50\n\n\ntrail was closed so there's definitely\n\n7:51\n\n\nWildlife here in Bryce Canyon uh but the\n\n7:54\n\n\npark rangers do a good job at uh trying\n\n7:55\n\n\nto make the the trail safe\n\n7:59\n\n\nnext we headed to Black Birch\n\n8:02\n\n\nCanyon now this one has very limited\n\n8:04\n\n\nparking uh we were lucky enough that as\n\n8:06\n\n\nwe were driving in there was a open\n\n8:08\n\n\nspace\n\n8:10\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n8:31\n\n\nfrom blackb Canyon we headed up to ympa\n\n8:33\n\n\npoint so ympa point and rainbow Point\n\n8:37\n\n\nshare the same parking lot but you'll\n\n8:39\n\n\nwant to park um when you first come in\n\n8:42\n\n\ncuz that's the trail to Yampa\n\n8:44\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n8:51\n\n\npoint so this is the parking lot for\n\n8:53\n\n\nboth the ampa point and rainbow point\n\n9:04\n\n\nyou'll see a sign to your vampa point\n\n9:07\n\n\nit's paved right here and then it goes\n\n9:09\n\n\nto dirt and then it goes back to

to\n\n1:46\n\n\nthe car and our next uh stop is\n\n1:49\n\n\nInspiration\n\n1:51\n\n\nPoint now Inspiration Point actually has\n\n1:54\n\n\ntwo different um overlooks so this is\n\n1:58\n\n\nthe parking lot and when you first come\n\n2:00\n\n\nout on the trail you'll be at lower\n\n2:02\n\n\nInspiration\n\n2:04\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n2:25\n\n\nPoint you'll see the sign for upper\n\n2:27\n\n\nInspiration Point and then you'll follow\n\n2:30\n\n\nthis dirt Trail so this dirt Trail is a\n\n2:32\n\n\nlittle bit steep um and this is a little\n\n2:34\n\n\nbit of a hike but when you get up to\n\n2:36\n\n\nUpper Inspiration Point the view is\n\n2:38\n\n\ndefinitely worth it\n\n2:44\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n3:00\n\n\nso then we hike back down the trail uh\n\n3:03\n\n\nback to the parking lot and then we're\n\n3:05\n\n\non to our next one which is Bryce\n\n3:11\n\n\npoint so Bryce Point has its own parking\n\n3:14\n\n\nlot as\n\n3:17\n\n\nwell you can see that it has its own\n\n3:19\n\n\ntrail to Peekaboo Loop and then you'll\n\n3:22\n\n\njust uh follow the pave Trail um to the\n\n3:25\n\n\nOverlook\n\n3:26\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n3:44\n\n\nthen we got back in our car and we\n\n3:46\n\n\nheaded on to the next one which is\n\n3:48\n\n\nPariah view Pariah view has its own\n\n3:51\n\n\nparking lot and then it has a pave Trail\n\n3:53\n\n\nall the way to the end\n\n3:59\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n4:09\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n4:20\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n4:27\n\n\nafter par VI we got in a car and we\n\n4:28\n\n\nheaded over to the swamp Canyon\n\n4:34\n\n\noverlook this has its own parking lot\n\n4:37\n\n\nand also a paved sidewalk and Overlook\n\n4:41\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n4:53\n\n\narea so next we went to far view point\n\n5:02\n\n\nfarview Point has its own parking lot um\n\n5:04\n\n\nthey also have a bathroom that's open in\n\n5:06\n\n\nthe summertime and then its own Overlook\n\n5:08\n\n\narea\n\n5:11\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n5:34\n\n\nso the far view parking lot also has a\n\n5:36\n\n\ntrail that goes to pyy point it's a dirt\n\n5:39\n\n\nTrail it's a pretty short hike um but at\n\n5:41\n\n\nthe end of the uh the trail you'll see\n\n5:43\n\n\npiracy point and then you can take it\n\n5:45\n\n\nback to the parking lot when you're done\n\n5:54\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n6:04\n\n\nso after piracy point we headed back to\n\n6:06\n\n\nthe farv view point parking lot and then\n\n6:08\n\n\nwe headed over to uh the Bryce Natural\n\n6:11\n\n\nBridge\n\n6:15\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n6:32\n\n\nthis was definitely one of our favorite\n\n6:34\n\n\nviews um next we got in the car and we\n\n6:37\n\n\nheaded over to AA Canyon overlook\n\n6:41\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n6:50\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n7:02\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n7:10\n\n\nso then we headed on to Ponderosa\n\n7:19\n\n\npoint a little bit higher\n\n7:22\n\n\nelevation and just amazing views of the\n\n7:24\n\n\nhoodoo\n\n7:36\n\n\nso there were some steps that took us to\n\n7:37\n\n\na trail that you could take back to AA\n\n7:40\n\n\nCanyon um but the trail was closed and\n\n7:43\n\n\nas we uh looked at the bulletin board\n\n7:45\n\n\nthat was just pass this it said warning\n\n7:48\n\n\nbare frequenting area and that's why the\n\n7:50\n\n\ntrail was closed so there's definitely\n\n7:51\n\n\nWildlife here in Bryce Canyon uh but the\n\n7:54\n\n\npark rangers do a good job at uh trying\n\n7:55\n\n\nto make the the trail safe\n\n7:59\n\n\nnext we headed to Black Birch\n\n8:02\n\n\nCanyon now this one has very limited\n\n8:04\n\n\nparking uh we were lucky enough that as\n\n8:06\n\n\nwe were driving in there was a open\n\n8:08\n\n\nspace\n\n8:10\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n8:31\n\n\nfrom blackb Canyon we headed up to ympa\n\n8:33\n\n\npoint so ympa point and rainbow Point\n\n8:37\n\n\nshare the same parking lot but you'll\n\n8:39\n\n\nwant to park um when you first come in\n\n8:42\n\n\ncuz that's the trail to Yampa\n\n8:44\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n8:51\n\n\npoint so this is the parking lot for\n\n8:53\n\n\nboth the ampa point and rainbow point\n\n9:04\n\n\nyou'll see a sign to your vampa point\n\n9:07\n\n\nit's paved right here and then it goes\n\n9:09\n\n\nto dirt and then it goes back to uh\n\n9:11\n\n\nbeing\n\n9:16\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n9:22\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n9:27\n\n\npaved and then from yva point we headed\n\n9:30\n\n\nback to the parking lot and then we just\n\n9:32\n\n\nstayed parked there and then we walked\n\n9:33\n\n\ndown to Rainbow\n\n9:38\n\n\nPoint rainbow points at the end of the\n\n9:40\n\n\nparking lot you'll see a building\n\n9:44\n\n\nthere you'll see that rainbow points at\n\n9:46\n\n\nthe highest elevation there's a building\n\n9:48\n\n\nthere it has some maps um tells you\n\n9:51\n\n\nabout the area and then it has this\n\n9:53\n\n\nbeautiful Overlook area\n\n9:59\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n10:18\n\n\nso rainbow point was the last of the\n\n10:20\n\n\noverlooks it's definitely worth doing\n\n10:22\n\n\nthis drive it's 18 mil back out of the\n\n10:24\n\n\npark um so make sure you have a full\n\n10:26\n\n\ntank of gas when you're doing this drive\n\n10:27\n\n\nbut it's definitely worth it\n\nNo results found\n\nTAP TO
