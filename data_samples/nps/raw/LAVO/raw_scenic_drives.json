Many of the park\u2019s features, popular trails, and visitor services are along this road. Three additional roads provide access to more remote areas: Butte Lake, Juniper Lake, and Warner Valley.<br>#### Winter Road Closures<br>During the snowy season (approximately November \u2013 June), park roads are closed and/or impassible due to heavy snowfall. Road closures are listed in alerts on the top of every webpage. Closures and additional information are available on the [Current Conditions](https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/conditions.htm) page.<br>## Lassen Park Highway<br>The park\u2019s main road is a 30-mile (48km) stretch of Highway 89 that runs north-south through the park. This scenic route passes through dense forest, open ridgelines cresting 8,512 feet near Lassen Peak trailhead, and descends steep volcanic slopes into the southwest area. Typically, the drive takes about one hour without stopping. Learn more about [driving the park highway](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/driveparkhwy.htm).<br>#### Travel Tips<br>- **Slow down and enjoy the drive** \u2013 the speed limit in the park is 35 mph unless posted otherwise. Adhering to posted speed limits is a great way to help spot and care for Lassen's wildlife.<br>  <br>- **Use pullouts to let others pass** if you're going to drive below the speed limit. Lassen Park Highway has no passing lanes or areas; please be courteous to other visitors.<br>  <br>- **Give 3 feet to bicyclists** as you pass on the road \u2013 it\u2019s California state law! Can't give three feet? Treat the bicyclist as you would a vehicle in front of you and wait to pass until you can give three feet.<br>  <br>## Park Highway Alternatives in Winter<br>It is possible to travel from one park entrance to the other on outside roads _around_ either the east or west side of the park.<br>### Travel Around the West Side of the Park<br>This route is the shortest route around the park. This windy road is not recommended for RVs and trailers. **Average travel time is 1 hour, 45 minutes. Average distance is 71 miles**.

The route crosses some of the most beautiful and undisturbed areas of the Pacific Northwest and it is an incredible drive that you should add to your bucket list. While I have not driven the entire thing, I have spent some time on the route and I wanted to share some of my favorite spots along the route in this post. Let me know what I left off in the comments.\n\n## Lassen Scenic Byway\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lassen-backpacking-11-640x427.jpg)\n\nThe first part of the route you will get to as you head north is Lassen Volcanic National Park and the Lassen Scenic Byway. The 185 mile loop takes you Through Lassen National Park and around the exterior of the park near Susanville. The park is full of amazing adventures to have and I wont cover them all in this post but you can read about [my favorite stops here](https://californiathroughmylens.com/lassen-national-park-hikes-lakes-caves). A few of the highlights are as follows.\n\n**Lake Helen and Lassen Peak**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/lassen-peak-2-1-2-640x427.jpg)\n\n[Lassen Peak](https://californiathroughmylens.com/2011/09/hiking-lassen-peak-lassen-volcanic-national-park/) is one of the best relatively easy summits you can do in the state. The hike is only 5 miles round trip and it takes you up to the top of the peak where you have incredible 360 degree views. If you don\u2019t want to do the hike though, you can just take photos of the mountain from the viewpoint at Lake Helen, which is spectacular as well.\n\n**Manzanita Lake**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lassen-backpacking-16-640x427.jpg)\n\nAs you make your way out of the park, be sure to stop at Manzanita Lake, another amazing viewpoint in Lassen Volcanic National Park. From here you can head north on Highway 44 and then stay on it to do the Lassen Scenic Byway Loop or follow Highway 89 to continue on the Volcanic Scenic Byway.\n\n**Subway Cave**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Subway-Cave-12-640x426.jpg)\n\nAs you continue north, you can stop near Old Station and see the [Subway Cave](https://californiathroughmylens.com/subway-cave-old-lava-tube-lassen-national-forrest/) there. It is a great little hike with an awesome cave you can walkthrough.\n\n**Burney Falls**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/burney-falls-640x426.jpg)\n\nAs you make it to the intersection of Highway 890 and Highway 299 you can take a short excursion to [Burney Falls](https://californiathroughmylens.com/mcarthur-burney-waterfall-northern-california) (and you should). It is not that far out of the way and it is one of my favorite waterfalls in the entire state.\n\n**McCloud Falls**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mccloud-snowshoe-20-640x427.jpg)\n\nContinuing north on Highway 89, you will want to keep your eyes peeled for [McCloud Falls](https://californiathroughmylens.com/mccloud-falls-waterfall-near-shasta). This waterfall has three tiers and you can drive to all three (not during the winter though).\n\n**Mt Shasta**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mt-shasta-hike-1-640x427.jpg)\n\nAs you make your way to the town of Mt Shasta, the road will connect with Highway 5. This will take you through the town of Mt Shasta and give you great views of the mountain in the distance. This is also a nice area to explore if you have more time; Lake Siskiyou is especially pretty.\n\n**Living Memorial Sculpture Garden**\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/living-memorial-sculpture-garden-9-640x427.jpg)\n\nTo stay on the route, you will leave Highway 5 and get on Highway 97. This route will take you towards the Oregon border and give you some great views of the mountain as you look behind you. Don\u2019t forget to stop at the [Living Memorial Sculpture Garden](https://californiathroughmylens.com/living-memorial-sculpture-garden/) on the way out, which has some beautiful sculptures in the shadow of the mountain.\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/skull-cave-3-640x427.jpg)\n\nHighway 97 is very scenic as you make your way to the Oregon Border. If you have the time, you can take an excursion over to Lava Beds National Monument, but I would not do this unless you have a good amount of time. Read more about the park [here](https://californiathroughmylens.com/lava-beds-guide).\n\nI haven\u2019t traveled the route outside of California, so that is the end of this post. I am sure that the route is just as impressive in Oregon though and I hope to update this post someday if I make it through that section.\n\n![](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/crater-lake-1-640x427.jpg)\n\nI have been to [Crater Lake](https://www.throughmylens.com/oregon/watchman-lookout-crater-lake/) and it was a pretty special spot for sure. Let me know what I left off in California and what I should look forward to in Oregon in the comments.\n\n## Similar Posts\n\nPosts 1 to 3 of 6\n\n[![San Luis Obispo to Monterey: Pacific Coast Highway Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bixby-Bridge-4-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-luis-obispo-monterey-guide/)\n\n[![San Francisco to Lake Tahoe Road Trip Stops](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lake-tahoe-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-francisco-lake-tahoe-road-trip-stops/)\n\n[![Highway 99 Road Trip Stops: Parks, Food, Treehouses & Gardens](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Bravo-Farms-9-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/highway-99-guide/)\n\n[![Eureka to Crescent City & Oregon State Line: Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/crescent-city-lighthouse-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/eureka-crescent-city-guide/)\n\n[![Dana Point to Malibu: Pacific Coast Highway Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Venice-Beach1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/dana-point-to-malibu-guide/)\n\n[![Weekend Adventure: Arches, Canyonlands, Horseshoe Bend & Antelope Canyon](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/utah-roadtrip-post.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/arches-canyonlands-utah/)\n\n[![San Luis Obispo to Monterey: Pacific Coast Highway Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bixby-Bridge-4-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-luis-obispo-monterey-guide/)\n\n[![San Francisco to Lake Tahoe Road Trip Stops](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lake-tahoe-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-francisco-lake-tahoe-road-trip-stops/)\n\n[![Highway 99 Road Trip Stops: Parks, Food, Treehouses & Gardens](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Bravo-Farms-9-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/highway-99-guide/)\n\n[![Eureka to Crescent City & Oregon State Line: Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/crescent-city-lighthouse-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/eureka-crescent-city-guide/)\n\n[![Dana Point to Malibu: Pacific Coast Highway Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Venice-Beach1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/dana-point-to-malibu-guide/)\n\n[![Weekend Adventure: Arches, Canyonlands, Horseshoe Bend & Antelope Canyon](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/utah-roadtrip-post.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/arches-canyonlands-utah/)\n\n[![San Luis Obispo to Monterey: Pacific Coast Highway Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bixby-Bridge-4-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-luis-obispo-monterey-guide/)\n\n[![San Francisco to Lake Tahoe Road Trip Stops](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lake-tahoe-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/san-francisco-lake-tahoe-road-trip-stops/)\n\n[![Highway 99 Road Trip Stops: Parks, Food, Treehouses & Gardens](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Bravo-Farms-9-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/highway-99-guide/)\n\n[![Eureka to Crescent City & Oregon State Line: Roadtrip Guide](https://californiathroughmylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/crescent-city-lighthouse-1-768x512.jpg)](https://californiathroughmylens.com/eureka-crescent-city-guide/)\n\nPreviousNext\n\nDisqus Recommendations\n\nWe were unable to load Disqus Recommendations.

The Lassen Volcanic National Park Scenic Drive, part of the famous Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway, is your path to an amazing world. You'll drive high up near Lassen Peak, the world's largest plug dome volcano, which erupted just over 100 years ago, creating this special place. Stop at Sulphur Works to see the earth steaming and bubbling\u2014you might smell a bit of rotten eggs, which just reminds you the volcano is still active! As you travel, look for colorful wildflowers, such as Indian Paintbrush, popping up from the rugged earth. Long ago, this whole area was used by emigrants heading west, and the mountain itself is named after Peter Lassen, who guided many travelers. It\u2019s a winding drive, so take your time and enjoy the powerful scenery.\n\nGet directionsCustomize route\n\n1 alert\n\nTop sights\n\n[Reflection Lake\\\\\n\\\\\nLake](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/shingletown/reflection-lake) [Tophet Springs\\\\\n\\\\\nSpring](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/shingletown/tophet-springs) [Summit Lake\\\\\n\\\\\nLake](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/old-station/summit-lake) Show more\n\nThis ad supports outdoor access for all\n\n[Remove ads](https://www.alltrails.com/plans)\n\nThis ad supports outdoor access for all\n\n[Remove ads](https://www.alltrails.com/plans)\n\nPreview![Plus badge image](https://d27scpai1jcyi9.cloudfront.net/trail-app-router/24bf7da03c3a79d54ba01401865ce678ad7381d8/_next/static/media/plus-full-light-text.ef713369.svg)\n\n\u00a9 Mapbox\u00a9 Maxar\u00a9 OpenStreetMap\n\nPlay\n\nTop sights\n\n[Reflection Lake\\\\\n\\\\\nLake](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/shingletown/reflection-lake) [Tophet Springs\\\\\n\\\\\nSpring](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/shingletown/tophet-springs) [Summit Lake\\\\\n\\\\\nLake](https://www.alltrails.com/poi/us/california/old-station/summit-lake) Show more\n\n## Plan your visit\n\nFee required\n\nKid-friendly\n\nPaved\n\nPartially paved\n\nForests\n\nLakes\n\nShow more\n\nTrailgoers are saying\n\n4.7\n\nHighlights include beautiful views, lots of wildflowers, and accessible features.

So not a lot of shade. But there are plenty of plants blooming right now that really make a beautiful contrast. Bench Lake is very shallow and right now it is full of tadpoles. Half of us took the rock steps up next to the falls and the other half took the less steep go around. So there are options for everyone. Definitely do go to the viewpoint that is a short leg of out and back. It is so pretty. Trekking poles are suggested.\n\nParking:Entry fee, Medium lot\n\n![Photo 1 of
