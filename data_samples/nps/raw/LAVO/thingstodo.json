    "longDescription": "<p>Snowshoes offer a way to explore the park in winter and spring, when roads and trails are hidden under snow. Each side of Lassen\u2019s main park road closure (southwest area and Manzanita Lake area) offer a variety of winter routes to <em>peruse on \u2018shoes</em>.</p> <p>Snowshoes are fitted with bindings that strap onto your winter boot. They have spikes underfoot to provide increased stability over hard-packed and icy snow. Decking is attached to a frame, creating a large surface area which prevents post-holing through deep snow. Winter boots are not the same as snowshoes.</p> <h2>Where to Go</h2> <p>In winter, there is no way to drive through the park. Most visitors tend to stick to one side of the road closure and access the park via Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center (southwest entrance) or Manzanita Lake (northwest entrance). Each side has multiple routes with varying length and difficulty.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">Southwest Area Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Visitor services, steeper slopes, and sweeping vistas)</em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-ml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Easier routes with gentle slopes and scenic lakes)</em></p> <p><strong><em>*Using the app offline?

Snowshoeing a trail can be much more tiring than hiking the same trail without snow. Remember to adjust your expectations of how far and how steep you can travel on snowshoes versus hiking in the summer.</p> <p>Snowshoeing strides are different than walking strides, as the shoes force your stance wider. If you\u2019re new to snowshoeing, we recommend trying different walking styles, such as swinging your hips more than normal.</p> <p>If the snow is particularly deep, use the kick-step technique to flick snow off the front of your snowshoe. As you are bringing your foot up, kick your foot to dislodge the extra snow. You may also need to stop periodically to pick out any snow clumps in the spikes of the snowshoe with a trekking pole.</p> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <p>Do not walk on ski tracks. Footprints and snowshoe tracks worsen conditions for skiers and using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</p> <p>Yield to faster skiers and/or downhill traffic. Step to side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill.</p>",

    "longDescription": "<p>Manzanita Lake is the most popular fishing lake in Lassen Volcanic National Park and is excellent for both rod and reel and fly fishing.\u00a0The\u00a0lake holds a fair number of rainbow and brown trout and is rated as a blue-ribbon fly fishery by the state of California Department of Fish and Game. This high-elevation lake (5,850 feet) offers spectacular views of the towering Lassen Peak and Chaos Crags volcanoes.\u00a0<br /> <br /> More than 300 years ago, a rock avalanche from Chaos Crags dammed Manzanita Creek creating this shallow lake. With a deepest point of\u00a0only 30 feet, trout often cruise the lake's large, shallow flats in search of food. Due to the large number of visitors to the lake, the fish are not easily spooked by humans.</p> <h4><strong>Regulations</strong></h4> <p>To ensure the availabilty of fish for all visitors, <strong>fishing in this lake is limited to catch and release with a single, barbless hook</strong>. Only lures and flies are permitted; no living or non-living bait may be used.\u00a0The lake is not stocked, however fish stocking did occur prior to the park's establishment in 1916. A California State fishing license is requred. Please review all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/management/fishing_regulations.htm\">fishing regulations</a> prior to fishing in the park.</p> <h4><b>Boating</b></h4> <p>Kayaks, canoes, waders, and float tubes are commonly used. Only non-motorized boats are permitted (boats may not carry or use a motor).\u00a0All watercraft must be\u00a0launched from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ml-day-use-area.htm\">boat launch</a> to prevent damage to the shoreline wetlands.\u00a0</p> <h4>Rod and Reel</h4> <p>For fishing with a rod and reel it is recommended that clear six-pound test line or smaller be used. At times the lake is crystal clear, and fish can see heavier line. A light spinning reel and nimble rod are a good choice for casting long distances and a sporting fight.</p> <h4>Fly Fishing</h4> <p>Manzanita Lake is nationally known for its fly-fishing opportunities. For fly fishing, a six-weight rod is recommended with a length of 9 to 10.5 feet with a #5 or #6 leader. Due to the abundance of willows around the lake, fly fishing can be challanging. Waders are advised. Most flies will work, however a few popular flies that work throughout the park are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Callibaetis (#16-18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Damsel Nymph (#14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachute Adams (#14-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Traditional Adams (#16-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibaetis Cripple (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Carpenter Ant (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bouface brown (#10)</p> </li> <li> <p>Monroe leech, olive (#10)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0Manzanita Lake Specific Flies:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Midge Patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>Pupa Patterns,</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibraetis Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Damselfly Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripping Nymphs,</p> </li> <li> <p>Leech Patterns\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Wooly Buggers</p> </li> </ul>",

    "longDescription": "<p>The boiling mudpots and hissing steam vents at Sulphur Works hydrothermal area are accessible year-round via a two-mile\u00a0round-trip, over-snow route. Hydrothermal features are visible on both sides of the snow-covered park highway route and\u00a0heat from these features often keeps the portion of road between them clear of snow. This is the only <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/exploring-the-hydrothermal-areas.htm\">park hydrothermal area</a> that is accessible in the winter months (approximately November through April). The 30-mile park highway\u00a0closes to through traffic in the snow season (approximately November through April).\u00a0</p> <h2>Get There</h2> <p><strong>Distance: </strong>2 miles round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 6,700 to 7,000 feet<br /> <strong>Average Snowshoeing\u00a0Time:</strong> 1 hour</p> <p>To access Sulphur Works, follow the snow-covered park highway route from the Southwest Area parking area. The route passes the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center and a sledding area. The one-mile route climbs gently along a hillside above Sulphur Creek and offers a partial view of Lassen Peak at about the halfway point. The left side of the route is bordered by steep side hills. Be aware of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-safety.htm#avalanche\">avalanche danger</a> by watching for movement\u00a0on the steep slopes above. Near the end of the route you will cross Sulphur Works bridge and the summertime Sulphur Works parking area on your left. Rising steam and the scent of rotting eggs makes your\u00a0destination is unmistakable. From here you can return the way you came, continue 1/2 mile\u00a0up the highway route to Windy Point, or begin the steep climb to Ridge Lakes. View these and other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">winter routes in the Southwest Area</a>.</p> <h2>Oversnow Travel</h2> <p>In the winter months, travel by snowshoe or cross-country ski is best for traveling over the deep snowpack. Bring your own equipment; rentals are not available in the park.\u00a0This popular route may be hardpacked, especially through the sledding area just beyond the visitor center. <strong>This route is recommended for advanced cross-country skiers only</strong> as footprints and snowshoe tracks on this popular route\u00a0freeze and make skiing more difficult. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/snowplayml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Area</a> offers better routes for beginners. We do not recommend walking without snowshoes unless the route is completely hardpacked. Otherwise, you should\u00a0be prepared for your feet and legs to break through the snow frequently\u00a0in an exhausting\u00a0experience known as post-holing. Learn about <a href=\"https://lnt.org/preventing-the-posthole/\">\u00a0why not creating postholes is good for everyone from Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics</a>.</p> <h2>Winter\u00a0Etiquette</h2> <p>Improve everyone's safety and enjoyment by adhering to the following winter etiquette recommendations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Do not walk on ski tracks.</strong>\u00a0Footprints and snowshoe tracks create hazards that make skiing more difficult.</li> <li><strong>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</strong>\u00a0Using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</li> <li><strong>Yield to faster skiers or downhill traffic.\u00a0</strong>Step to the side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill, as they are working harder and have the right of way.</li> </ul>",
