      "bodyText": "<p>Imagine a rock slide racing nearly 100 miles per\u00a0hour down Chaos Crags lava dome volcanoes at this very spot.\u00a0The jumbled rocks\u00a0surrounding you are the\u00a0result of a series of 3 rockfall avalanches that occurred around\u00a01660. The first and largest avalanche covers about 2.5 square miles (6.8 square km)\u00a0and created this undulating landscape.<br /> <br /> What caused the rock avalanches? Geologists believe\u00a0that the dacite rock that forms Chaos Crags lava domes\u00a0broke free. Years of freeze and thaw created cracks in the fragile rocks and\u00a0weakened their bond. Steep-sided slopes allowed the loose rock to break free and rush downslope. Geologists describe the rocks here floating on a cushion of air during the avalanche. The rocks gained such high speeds, that air became trapped between the ground and rocks. With friction reduced, the rocks were able to flow very far. As they came to a rest on the edges of the flow, rocks in the center continued to move at a rapid rate, creating <em>frozen waves</em>.</p>",

      "listingDescription": "High atop Mt. Harkness, this rustic fire lookout is still accessible to hikers.",
      "bodyText": "<p>Perched atop Mt. Harkness in the southeast corner of Lassen Volcanic National Park, Mount Harkness Fire Lookout has served\u00a0as an active fire lookout and visitor destination since its construction in 1930. The rustic style two-story wood and stone structure sits at 8,046 feet elevation\u00a0on\u00a0the summit of an ancient shield volcano topped by a cinder cone. Visitors are able to access the summit and lookout by trail from either Juniper Lake or Warner Valley.\u00a0The shortest and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/hiking_mount_harkness.htm\">most popular trail</a> climbs 1.9 miles and 1,250 feet from Juniper Lake Campground to the summit.\u00a0The sweeping vistas from the lookout span from the Three Sisters peaks in Oregon to the north, the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the south, and the Coast Range to the west. Fire staff reside in the lookout in the summer months and share information on the lookout and operations with visitors.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Mt. Harkness Fire Lookout was destroyed in the Dixie Fire in August 2021.</span></strong></p> <h2>A Model of\u00a0NPS Rustic Architecture</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout and accompanying pit toilet were\u00a0constructed primarily of local stone and wood in a style typical for National Park structures built in\u00a0the 1920s and 1930s. The design philosophy centered on the use of local\u00a0materials\u00a0to make structures compatible with their environment and to achieve visual unity among different facilities. The lookout is unusual in comparison to the vast majority of fire lookouts and associated pit toilets in the United States, which are either of wood frame or steel construction. The top level is comprised of a\u00a0single-room cabin, surrounded on four sides by\u00a0a wooden catwalk and topped by a pitched wood shingle roof. A wooden staircase climbs the 12 feet to the catwalk and masonry of battered native stone extends from the ground to the windows on the upper floor.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h2>A Classic Fire Lookout</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout continues to use many of the station's original technology and systems. A report to the\u00a0Director of the National Park Service described the newly constructed facility the year following its construction:\u00a0</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"A fire-lookout station constructed during the season on top of Mount Harkness in Lassen Volcanic National Park is among the finest and best equipped in northern California. In addition to the usual maps and compasses, it contains an <a href=\"3a1b676c-13df-43af-b4b1-d8b9e17f5695\">Osborne fire finder</a> and a panoramic photograph mounted so\u00a0that the location of the fire will be shown simultaneously on the photograph and the map when detected by the fire finder. This station serves a triple purpose. In addition to its importance in the fire prevention program of Lassen, it affords visitors, who may easily reach it by trail, an opportunity to view the country through powerful glasses, and it also contains a seismograph, which, in connection with two others, hourly records the slightest quivers of the earth.\"</p> <p>While some systems like the seismograph have since been replaced by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/nature/seismic-activity.htm\">digital seismic monitoring</a>, the fire observation tools have remained the same. Adopted in the\u00a01850s, classic fire monitoring systems using maps and a compass function without electricity or Internet access (the lookout has neither). The building itself has seen a\u00a0few upgrades over its many decades\u00a0of service, including the addition of a weather monitoring station and radio repeater (powered by solar panels) and conversion from a wood to propane stove.</p> <h2>Maintaining a Historic Lookout</h2> <p>Extreme winters, rugged terrain, and regular use leave the Mount Harkness Fire Lookout in regular need of maintenance. In recent years, park staff and partners have replaced the roof and rehabilitated the original\u00a0wooden doors and windows. In 2019, the park began a new rehabilitation project in partnership with <a href=\"https://historicorps.org/harkness-lookout-ca-2019/\">HistoriCorps</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to engaging volunteers on the rehabilitation of historic structures on publicly accessible lands. Between September 15 and\u00a027 a group of HistoriCorps volunteers will work with park staff to remove and repoint failing mortar, replace deteriorated boards on the catwalk, and repair deteriorated window trim and door frames.<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></span></span></span>The HistoriCorps crew will camp at Juniper Lake Campground\u00a0and then hike up to the project site daily.<br /> \u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

Return along same route to avoid avalanche-prone slopes above Sulphur Works and along the park highway route north of Windy Point.\u00a0</p> <h2>Advanced Routes</h2> <p>Travel outside of the highway corridor is recommended only for experienced winter travelers.</p> <h4>Brokeoff Mountain</h4> <p>Distance: 7 miles (11.3km) roundtrip<br /> Elevation: 6650 to 9250 feet<br /> Average Skiing Time: 8 hours</p> <p>Traditional routes use the Forest Lake route (near parking area) or the summer trail that begins near the park entrance. Numerous avalanche paths exist on all aspects of the mountain. Travelers should use extreme caution. Many skiers reserve travel to the summit for spring when snow conditions traditionally stabilize. Summit conditions during inclement weather often include high winds with little or no visibility. Be cautious of overhanging cornices at the summit.</p> <h4>Lassen Peak</h4> <p>Distance: 17 miles (27.4km) roundtrip<br /> Elevation: 6700 to 10457 feet<br /> Average Skiing Time: 3 days</p> <p>Most travelers allow three days to summit Lassen Peak in the winter. Be prepared for high winds in the Lassen Peak and Lake Helen areas. Conditions on the mountain are most stable in early morning hours; afternoon travel is not recommended. The safest route up the mountain follows the summer trail through the forested section and continues on the southeast ridge to the summit. Weather conditions on Lassen Peak can deteriorate rapidly, creating white out conditions and high winds.It is advised to travel the Ranger Cutoff to avoid the road corridor skirting the base of Diamond Peak which is prone to avalanche. Travel beyond Ranger Cutoff may be impassable due to snow-drifted areas along the Emerald Sidehill.</p>",

      "longDescription": "<p>Snowshoes offer a way to explore the park in winter and spring, when roads and trails are hidden under snow. Each side of Lassen\u2019s main park road closure (southwest area and Manzanita Lake area) offer a variety of winter routes to <em>peruse on \u2018shoes</em>.</p> <p>Snowshoes are fitted with bindings that strap onto your winter boot. They have spikes underfoot to provide increased stability over hard-packed and icy snow. Decking is attached to a frame, creating a large surface area which prevents post-holing through deep snow. Winter boots are not the same as snowshoes.</p> <h2>Where to Go</h2> <p>In winter, there is no way to drive through the park. Most visitors tend to stick to one side of the road closure and access the park via Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center (southwest entrance) or Manzanita Lake (northwest entrance). Each side has multiple routes with varying length and difficulty.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">Southwest Area Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Visitor services, steeper slopes, and sweeping vistas)</em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-ml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Easier routes with gentle slopes and scenic lakes)</em></p> <p><strong><em>*Using the app offline? Navigate to \u201cVisiting in Winter\u201d to see route descriptions and maps.</em></strong></p> <h2>Gear Rentals</h2> <p>Rentals may\u00a0be available in nearby communities of Shingletown (northwest entrance), Mineral (southwest entrance), Red Bluff and Redding (both).<br /> Note - Snowshoe or other winter equipment rentals are not available at the park.</p> <h2>Snowshoeing Tips</h2> <p>Snowshoeing is different than hiking or any other form of recreation. Snowshoeing a trail can be much more tiring than hiking the same trail without snow. Remember to adjust your expectations of how far and how steep you can travel on snowshoes versus hiking in the summer.</p> <p>Snowshoeing strides are different than walking strides, as the shoes force your stance wider. If you\u2019re new to snowshoeing, we recommend trying different walking styles, such as swinging your hips more than normal.</p> <p>If the snow is particularly deep, use the kick-step technique to flick snow off the front of your snowshoe. As you are bringing your foot up, kick your foot to dislodge the extra snow. You may also need to stop periodically to pick out any snow clumps in the spikes of the snowshoe with a trekking pole.</p> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <p>Do not walk on ski tracks. Footprints and snowshoe tracks worsen conditions for skiers and using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</p> <p>Yield to faster skiers and/or downhill traffic. Step to side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill.</p>",

      "longDescription": "<p>The boiling mudpots and hissing steam vents at Sulphur Works hydrothermal area are accessible year-round via a two-mile\u00a0round-trip, over-snow route. Hydrothermal features are visible on both sides of the snow-covered park highway route and\u00a0heat from these features often keeps the portion of road between them clear of snow. This is the only <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/exploring-the-hydrothermal-areas.htm\">park hydrothermal area</a> that is accessible in the winter months (approximately November through April). The 30-mile park highway\u00a0closes to through traffic in the snow season (approximately November through April).\u00a0</p> <h2>Get There</h2> <p><strong>Distance: </strong>2 miles round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 6,700 to 7,000 feet<br /> <strong>Average Snowshoeing\u00a0Time:</strong> 1 hour</p> <p>To access Sulphur Works, follow the snow-covered park highway route from the Southwest Area parking area. The route passes the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center and a sledding area. The one-mile route climbs gently along a hillside above Sulphur Creek and offers a partial view of Lassen Peak at about the halfway point. The left side of the route is bordered by steep side hills. Be aware of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-safety.htm#avalanche\">avalanche danger</a> by watching for movement\u00a0on the steep slopes above. Near the end of the route you will cross Sulphur Works bridge and the summertime Sulphur Works parking area on your left. Rising steam and the scent of rotting eggs makes your\u00a0destination is unmistakable. From here you can return the way you came, continue 1/2 mile\u00a0up the highway route to Windy Point, or begin the steep climb to Ridge Lakes. View these and other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">winter routes in the Southwest Area</a>.</p> <h2>Oversnow Travel</h2> <p>In the winter months, travel by snowshoe or cross-country ski is best for traveling over the deep snowpack. Bring your own equipment; rentals are not available in the park.\u00a0This popular route may be hardpacked, especially through the sledding area just beyond the visitor center. <strong>This route is recommended for advanced cross-country skiers only</strong> as footprints and snowshoe tracks on this popular route\u00a0freeze and make skiing more difficult. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/snowplayml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Area</a> offers better routes for beginners. We do not recommend walking without snowshoes unless the route is completely hardpacked. Otherwise, you should\u00a0be prepared for your feet and legs to break through the snow frequently\u00a0in an exhausting\u00a0experience known as post-holing. Learn about <a href=\"https://lnt.org/preventing-the-posthole/\">\u00a0why not creating postholes is good for everyone from Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics</a>.</p> <h2>Winter\u00a0Etiquette</h2> <p>Improve everyone's safety and enjoyment by adhering to the following winter etiquette recommendations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Do not walk on ski tracks.</strong>\u00a0Footprints and snowshoe tracks create hazards that make skiing more difficult.</li> <li><strong>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</strong>\u00a0Using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</li> <li><strong>Yield to faster skiers or downhill traffic.\u00a0</strong>Step to the side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill, as they are working harder and have the right of way.</li> </ul>",
