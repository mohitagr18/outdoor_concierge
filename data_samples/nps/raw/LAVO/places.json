    "listingDescription": "Are you avalanche aware? While these tips and resources don't take the place of a formal avalanche safety training, they are a great reminder to review before hitting the snow!",
    "bodyText": "<p>Snow travel at Lassen Volcanic National Park requires entering avalanche terrain. Each year, avalanches claim more than 150 lives worldwide. Knowledge, information, and equipment are key to preventing and surviving avalanche accidents. Before you enter the winter wilderness, ensure that you have a solid understanding of avalanche awareness and carry avalanche/rescue equipment.</p> <h2>Are You Prepared?</h2> <h4>Make a Plan</h4> <p>Travel with a partner\u2014know your abilities and their\u2019s. Plan a route avoiding hazard areas and include alternatives. Tell someone where you are going and when you will return.</p> <h4>Know the Snow</h4> <p>Use a basic pole test or more involved tests such as a snow pit, Rutschblock, or extended column to evaluate the snow as you travel through avalanche terrain throughout the day.</p> <h4>Bring Your Equipment</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Snow Shovel</strong> to test snow conditions, dig out victims, make snow shelters.</li> <li><strong>Probe</strong> to find buried avalanche victims.</li> <li><strong>Avalanche Transceiver (Beacon)</strong> emits a pulsed radio signal to help locate buried avalanche victims.</li> </ul> <h4>Check the Forecast</h4> <p>Lassen Volcanic National Park does not provide an avalanche forecast for the park. Forecasts from the following nearby areas may provide some information on regional conditions, but may not reflect conditions in the park.</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.shastaavalanche.org/#/all\">Mt. Shasta Avalanche Center</a> (530-926-9613)</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"http://www.sierraavalanchecenter.org/\">Sierra Avalanche Center</a>\u00a0(Lake Tahoe area; 530-587-3558)</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://avalanche.org/\">Interactive map of Avalanche forecasts in the U.S.</a></p> </li> </ul> <h2>Recognize Red Flags</h2> <h4>Recent Avalanches</h4> <p>If there are new avalanches, more are possible.</p> <h4>Signs of Unstable Snow as You Travel</h4> <p>Listen for warning signs: cracking or collapsing snowpack, \u201cwhumpfing\u201d sounds, and hollow drum-like sounds on hard snow.</p> <h4>Heavy Snowfall or Rain in the Past 24 Hours</h4> <p>Significant snowfall or rain can make the snowpack unstable. Avalanches are often triggered the first clear day after a storm. Because it is sunny does not mean it is safe.</p> <h4>Windblown Snow</h4> <p>Windblown snow loads leeward slopes, even when it is not snowing out.</p> <h4>Significant Warming or Rapidly Increasing Temperatures</h4> <p>Warm temperatures can cause the snow to creep downhill and become less stable.</p> <h4>Persistent Weak Layers</h4> <p>When these are buried in the snowpack, you may trigger an avalanche weeks after a storm or when no other red flags are present.</p> <h2>Identify Avalanche Terrain</h2> <h4>Slope Angle</h4> <p>Avalanches are possible on any slope steeper than 30 degrees and as steep as 50 degrees. They occur most frequently on slopes 35 to 45 degrees. Avalanches may also occur on slopes of less than 30 degrees that are exposed to steeper terrain above.</p> <h4>Aspect</h4> <p>Which way does the slop face in relation to sun or wind? Cornices indicate prevailing wind direction and may be a sign the slope is being windloaded. Does the slope face the sun or is it in the shade?</p> <h4>Common Trigger Points</h4> <p>Avalanches may be triggered from flatter areas in the runout zone or along ridge crests. Watch for wind deposited snow; breakover or mid-slope steepening; areas ner rock outcrops; or shallow areas in the snowpack.</p> <h4>Terrain Traps</h4> <p>Watch for anything that increases the consequences of being caught in a slide, like cliffs, trees, and rocks. A flat transition or a gully means a deeper burial.</p> <h2>Frequent Avalanche Terrain</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lassen Volcanic National Park Highway:</strong> Hazardous, steep side hills with icy conditions and numerous avalanche paths.Diamond Peak Area: History of avalanches; avoid it by using the Ranger Cutoff north of Windy Point.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ridge Lakes Area:</strong> History of avalanches in the area south of Ridge Lakes. There are steep windloaded slopes on the north side and steep, avalanche-prone slopes on all aspects of Mt. Diller.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lassen Peak:</strong> Steep slopes with various aspects. The safest way up is on the summer trail through the forested section, then on the southeast ridge to the summit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brokeoff Mountain:</strong> Numerous avalanche paths and overhanging cornices on the summit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loomis Peak:</strong> Avalanche cutes sluff off of Loomis Peak at the upper end of the Manzanita Creek Trail.</p> </li> </ul>",

Geologists believe\u00a0that the dacite rock that forms Chaos Crags lava domes\u00a0broke free. Years of freeze and thaw created cracks in the fragile rocks and\u00a0weakened their bond. Steep-sided slopes allowed the loose rock to break free and rush downslope. Geologists describe the rocks here floating on a cushion of air during the avalanche. The rocks gained such high speeds, that air became trapped between the ground and rocks. With friction reduced, the rocks were able to flow very far. As they came to a rest on the edges of the flow, rocks in the center continued to move at a rapid rate, creating <em>frozen waves</em>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This historic Loomis Museum offers park\u00a0history and current\u00a0visitor information\u00a0in the\u00a0Manzanita Lake Area of Lassen Volcanic National Park. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-franklin-loomis.htm\">Benjamin Franklin (B.F.)\u00a0Loomis</a> constructed the building in 1927 to display his collection of park photographs.\u00a0Images of the dramatic eruption captured the attention of the nation and helped garner support for the park's establishment and remain a feature of the museum to this day.</p> <h2>Mae Loomis Memorial Museum</h2> <p>In 1927, B.F.\u00a0Loomis and his wife <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/estella-loomis.htm\">Estella</a>\u00a0constructed a museum\u00a0in\u00a0honor of their only daughter who had died seven years\u00a0earlier at the age of 21.\u00a0Loomis described his daughter as a great lover of nature who had been happiest when rambling through forests and among mountains.\u00a0With no other offspring\u00a0Loomis and his wife Estella felt it was their duty to the public to build a museum for the preservation of his photograph collection.<br /> <br /> <em>Our object in building the museum is for the preservation of the photographic record of what the volcano has done. Many good photographs have been made of the volcano in action, but in another decade many of them will be lost or destroyed. It is necessary that a museum should be build so these pictures may be preserved indefinitely. </em>-B.F. Loomis, excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Pictorial_History_of_the_Lassen_Volcano/pU4OAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Pictorial%20history%20of%20the%20Lassen%20volcano&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover&bsq=Pictorial%20history%20of%20the%20Lassen%20volcano\">Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano</a>, 1926.<br /> <br /> The museum building was constructed of native stone and reinforced concrete, with 20 skylights set into the dome-shaped roof. The interior consisted of a main hall devoted primarily to geologic exhibits, including photographs that Loomis had made of the eruptions.\u00a0A back wing featured mounted animal displays with background images Benjamin took and Estella hand-tinted.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loomis also constructed the\u00a0seismograph building, located near the front of the museum, out of\u00a0different types of igneous rock. Inside, visitors could watch a seismograph in operation under glass as it recorded the Earth\u2019s slightest movements, its pendulum-mounted needle inking tremulous lines across a perpetually revolving spool of paper.</p> <h2>An Extraordinary Gift</h2> <p>On February 4, 1929, B.F. and Estella Loomis signed the deed granting their 40-acre tract together with their museum and seismograph building as a gift to the national park. The initial boundaries of the park encompassed 82,800 acres (compared to 106,538 acres\u00a0today) and excluded a number of privately owned land tracts.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The donation became possible only after the act of Congress of January 19, 1929, extended the boundaries of the park to include the Manzanita Lake area. When the land and the buildings were deeded to the government in February 1929, few other national parks had museums and not one of these had been built and donated by private individuals. The gift of the museum vaulted Lassen Volcanic National Park into the first tier of parks with scientific and educational programs.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=06be7256-b0b2-407e-a5c0-c0758eea1e4b\">Loomis Museum was added to the National Register of Historic Places</a>\u00a0(NRHP) in 1975. The building is included in the NRHP-listed\u00a0<a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=c9c94a53-9aa4-4aaf-b26b-0ef67ef84f9e\">Manzanita Lake Naturalist's Services Historic District</a>, which also includes the seismograph building, Loomis Residence, Manzanita Creek footbridge,\u00a0the Naturalist's Residence, and the Manzanita Lake, Reflection Lake, and Lily Pond Trails.</p> <h2>The Loomis Residence</h2> <p>Shortly after Benjamin\u00a0and Estella\u00a0Loomis deeded their property to the national park, they sold their hotel in Viola and built a small summer across the present-day plaza from the museum. Under the terms of their gift deed, they retained the right to a lifetime lease on the property. The small lease was just big enough to accommodate their home and a photo and art store, in which they sold film, cameras, pictures, and postcards. B.F. lived until 1935.\u00a0Upon her death in 1953, Estella donated the Loomis residence\u00a0to the park.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Perched atop Mt. Harkness in the southeast corner of Lassen Volcanic National Park, Mount Harkness Fire Lookout has served\u00a0as an active fire lookout and visitor destination since its construction in 1930. The rustic style two-story wood and stone structure sits at 8,046 feet elevation\u00a0on\u00a0the summit of an ancient shield volcano topped by a cinder cone. Visitors are able to access the summit and lookout by trail from either Juniper Lake or Warner Valley.\u00a0The shortest and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/hiking_mount_harkness.htm\">most popular trail</a> climbs 1.9 miles and 1,250 feet from Juniper Lake Campground to the summit.\u00a0The sweeping vistas from the lookout span from the Three Sisters peaks in Oregon to the north, the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the south, and the Coast Range to the west. Fire staff reside in the lookout in the summer months and share information on the lookout and operations with visitors.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Mt. Harkness Fire Lookout was destroyed in the Dixie Fire in August 2021.</span></strong></p> <h2>A Model of\u00a0NPS Rustic Architecture</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout and accompanying pit toilet were\u00a0constructed primarily of local stone and wood in a style typical for National Park structures built in\u00a0the 1920s and 1930s. The design philosophy centered on the use of local\u00a0materials\u00a0to make structures compatible with their environment and to achieve visual unity among different facilities. The lookout is unusual in comparison to the vast majority of fire lookouts and associated pit toilets in the United States, which are either of wood frame or steel construction. The top level is comprised of a\u00a0single-room cabin, surrounded on four sides by\u00a0a wooden catwalk and topped by a pitched wood shingle roof. A wooden staircase climbs the 12 feet to the catwalk and masonry of battered native stone extends from the ground to the windows on the upper floor.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h2>A Classic Fire Lookout</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout continues to use many of the station's original technology and systems. A report to the\u00a0Director of the National Park Service described the newly constructed facility the year following its construction:\u00a0</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"A fire-lookout station constructed during the season on top of Mount Harkness in Lassen Volcanic National Park is among the finest and best equipped in northern California. In addition to the usual maps and compasses, it contains an <a href=\"3a1b676c-13df-43af-b4b1-d8b9e17f5695\">Osborne fire finder</a> and a panoramic photograph mounted so\u00a0that the location of the fire will be shown simultaneously on the photograph and the map when detected by the fire finder. This station serves a triple purpose. In addition to its importance in the fire prevention program of Lassen, it affords visitors, who may easily reach it by trail, an opportunity to view the country through powerful glasses, and it also contains a seismograph, which, in connection with two others, hourly records the slightest quivers of the earth.\"</p> <p>While some systems like the seismograph have since been replaced by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/nature/seismic-activity.htm\">digital seismic monitoring</a>, the fire observation tools have remained the same. Adopted in the\u00a01850s, classic fire monitoring systems using maps and a compass function without electricity or Internet access (the lookout has neither). The building itself has seen a\u00a0few upgrades over its many decades\u00a0of service, including the addition of a weather monitoring station and radio repeater (powered by solar panels) and conversion from a wood to propane stove.</p> <h2>Maintaining a Historic Lookout</h2> <p>Extreme winters, rugged terrain, and regular use leave the Mount Harkness Fire Lookout in regular need of maintenance. In recent years, park staff and partners have replaced the roof and rehabilitated the original\u00a0wooden doors and windows. In 2019, the park began a new rehabilitation project in partnership with <a href=\"https://historicorps.org/harkness-lookout-ca-2019/\">HistoriCorps</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to engaging volunteers on the rehabilitation of historic structures on publicly accessible lands. Between September 15 and\u00a027 a group of HistoriCorps volunteers will work with park staff to remove and repoint failing mortar, replace deteriorated boards on the catwalk, and repair deteriorated window trim and door frames.<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">\u00a0</span></span></span></span>The HistoriCorps crew will camp at Juniper Lake Campground\u00a0and then hike up to the project site daily.<br /> \u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Reflection Lake wasn't always named such. In the late 1800s, the lake was lower in level and more indicative of a pond and\u00a0was aptly named, Mud Lake. To attract more people to the area, a channel was dug to divert water from Manzanita Creek into Mud Lake. Trout were planted in the lake with an increased water level. For a few years, people paid the landowner to fish in the lake. Eventually, trout planting ceased.<br /> <br /> In 1926,\u00a0park benefactor\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-franklin-loomis.htm\">Benjamin Franklin Loomis</a> purchased 40 acres, which included the lake. Reflection Lake was one location that\u00a0Loomis captured photographs of the 1914-1945\u00a0Lassen Peak eruptions. Loomis and his wife Estella\u00a0donated their 40 acres, the Loomis Museum, and the\u00a0adjacent seismograph building to the park in 1929.<br /> <br /> A healthy population of native tui chub fish thrive in the warmer water. Fish stocking ended completely in the park in the early 1990s\u00a0to preserve natural riparian ecosystems. As a result, the lake attracts water birds such as Canada geese, great blue heron, snowy egret, and kingfisher.</p> <h4>Reflection Lake Route</h4> <p>A half-mile route (not a defined trail)\u00a0circles the lake and is a\u00a0shorter alternative to\u00a0the 1.8-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walkmanzanitalake.htm\">Manzanita Lake Loop</a>. The western shore offers\u00a0unobstructed views of Chaos Crags and Lassen Peak, which are often reflected in the still lake. The route overlaps with the half-mile\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walklilypond.htm\">Lily Pond Interpretive Trail</a> on the eastern shore of Reflection Lake.</p>",

The route climbs rapidly along the east side of West Sulphur Creek to the Ridge Lakes basin (1.1mi/1.8km). Return along same route.</p> <p><em>Backcountry Camping: Several good camping spots can be found on the north shore of Ridge Lakes. If weather is severe, more protected camping can be found about \u00bc mile below Ridge Lakes along its outlet creek. Avoid the area south of Ridge Lakes during periods of increased avalanche danger.</em></p> <p><em>Hydrothermal Area Safety: Maintain a safe distance from hydrothermal features.

Veer left at the marker for the Ranger Cutoff just beyond the point. The route climbs a gentle slope to a ridge with excellent views of Brokeoff Mountain and Sulphur Works. Stop here or continue along the ridge as it gradually narrows, providing views of Lassen Peak and eventually opening onto a steep slope at the western foot of Diamond Peak (~0.5mi/0.8km). Return along same route to avoid avalanche-prone slopes above Sulphur Works and along the park highway route north of Windy Point.\u00a0</p> <h2>Advanced Routes</h2> <p>Travel outside of the highway corridor is recommended only for experienced winter travelers.</p> <h4>Brokeoff Mountain</h4> <p>Distance: 7 miles (11.3km) roundtrip<br /> Elevation: 6650 to 9250 feet<br /> Average Skiing Time: 8 hours</p> <p>Traditional routes use the Forest Lake route (near parking area) or the summer trail that begins near the park entrance. Numerous avalanche paths exist on all aspects of the mountain. Travelers should use extreme caution. Many skiers reserve travel to the summit for spring when snow conditions traditionally stabilize. Summit conditions during inclement weather often include high winds with little or no visibility. Be cautious of overhanging cornices at the summit.</p> <h4>Lassen Peak</h4> <p>Distance: 17 miles (27.4km) roundtrip<br /> Elevation: 6700 to 10457 feet<br /> Average Skiing Time: 3 days</p> <p>Most travelers allow three days to summit Lassen Peak in the winter. Be prepared for high winds in the Lassen Peak and Lake Helen areas. Conditions on the mountain are most stable in early morning hours; afternoon travel is not recommended. The safest route up the mountain follows the summer trail through the forested section and continues on the southeast ridge to the summit. Weather conditions on Lassen Peak can deteriorate rapidly, creating white out conditions and high winds.It is advised to travel the Ranger Cutoff to avoid the road corridor skirting the base of Diamond Peak which is prone to avalanche. Travel beyond Ranger Cutoff may be impassable due to snow-drifted areas along the Emerald Sidehill.</p>",

    "listingDescription": "Review these safety tips and resources before you start your winter adventure!",
    "bodyText": "<p>Your safety is your responsibility. Be prepared for severe and possibly rapid-changing winter weather in a remote, high-elevation area. There is little to no cell service in the park and services are limited. Be prepared to self-rescue in emergencies. When in doubt, wait for a safer day to visit.</p> <h2>Plan Ahead</h2> <link /> <ul> <li>Check the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather forecast</a> before visiting. Don\u2019t forget to check multiple forecasts if traveling through different areas (forecasts may differ based on elevation)!</li> <li>Know where you\u2019re going and bring a map with you. Trails look different in the winter and visibility can be poor if it\u2019s windy or snowing.</li> <li>Choose an activity based on the skill/ability level of the weakest, youngest, or least experienced member of your group. Trails and elevations you explored in summer may be more difficult in winter.</li> <li>Have a Plan B (and maybe a Plan C). Be flexible with your trip plan and have backup options. Reasons to change plans may include: group member comfort levels, changing weather conditions, park closures for safety concerns, or gear malfunction. Remember, it is always okay to turn around or delay your adventure to another day or time.</li> <li>Tell someone not in your travel group your plans. Even if you are visiting with a group, tell someone else your itinerary and any alternate plans, your group members and size, and when you expect to return. Don\u2019t forget to reach out after your trip to let them know you\u2019re safe!</li> <li>Be <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/avalanche-awareness-lassen.htm\">avalanche aware</a> if traveling in known avalanche-prone areas, beyond established routes, or in steep terrain.</li> </ul> <h2>Recreating in a Remote Area</h2> <ul> <li>We highly suggest recreating in groups and/or carrying a emergency locator device when exploring anywhere in the park, but especially farther than one mile from parking areas.</li> <li>If you have an emergency and have cell service, call 911. Free Wi-Fi is available in the immediate vicinity of the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center. There is no public Wi-Fi in the Manzanita Lake area.</li> <li>There is no gas available in the park.</li> </ul> <h2>Access & Driving</h2> <p>Expect the main park road to be closed in winter. Access is typically available to the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center (southwest entrance) and Loomis Plaza/Manzanita Lake (northwest entrance). Roads and facilities may close unexpectedly due to severe weather. All closures will be posted in alerts on our website on the app park landing page. Visitor information line also has recording of current closures at (530) 595-4480 (phone function intermittent).</p> <ul> <li>During heavy snowfall, southwest area plowing operations end at 1:30pm. Visitors are strongly encouraged to exit the park behind the snowplow to avoid traveling through deep snowpack.</li> <li>Roads <b>to and around</b> the park may also have adverse driving conditions. Check <a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/\">Caltrans</a> for external road conditions: Hwy 36 for southwest entrance, Hwy 44 and/or 89 for northwest entrance.</li> <li>Always carry an emergency kit in your car in case it breaks down or if you must wait out a storm. Your car emergency kit can include items like a snow shovel, ice scraper, sand/kitty litter, jumper cables, tow chains or ropes, extra water, and snacks.</li> </ul> <h2>Wear Appropriate Clothing</h2> <ul> <li>Wear/carry waterproof clothing and gear. Choose clothing made of wool or synthetic material over cotton - Cotton absorbs moisture easily and won\u2019t keep you warm if it gets wet.</li> <li>Pack layers for warmth. We recommend carrying extra layers with you, just in case.</li> <li>Wear sun protection, like sunglasses and sunscreen. California sun doesn\u2019t stop just because it\u2019s winter!</li> <li>Don\u2019t forget to bring water and snacks, a map, and a friend.</li> </ul> <h2>Watch For Cold Related Illness</h2> <p>Hypothermia is a serious health hazard that occurs when your body loses heat too quickly and can no longer keep itself warm. Frostbite can cause a loss of feeling and color in the areas it affects, usually fingers and toes; severe cases can lead to amputation.</p> <h4>Signs & Symptoms of Hypothermia:</h4> <ul> <li>Shivering</li> <li>Exhaustion or feeling very tired</li> <li>Confusion</li> <li>Fumbling hands</li> <li>Memory loss</li> <li>Slurred speech</li> <li>Drowsiness</li> <li>In infants: Bright red, cold skin and very low energy</li> </ul> <h4>How to Treat Hypothermia</h4> <ul> <li>If temperature is below 95 F, get medical attention right away!</li> <li>Get the person into a warm room or shelter.</li> <li>Remove any wet clothing the person is wearing.</li> <li>Warm the center of the person's body\u2014chest, neck, head, and groin\u2014using an electric blanket, if available. You can also use skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers of blankets, clothing, towels, or sheets. Warm drinks can help increase body temperature.</li> <li>After body temperature has increased, keep the person dry and wrap their body, including their head and neck, in a warm blanket.</li> </ul> <h4>Signs & Symptoms of Frostbite</h4> <ul> <li>Redness or pain in any skin area may be the first sign of frostbite</li> <li>White or grayish-yellow area on skin</li> <li>Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy</li> <li>Numbness</li> </ul> <h4>How to Treat Frostbite</h4> <p>Frostbite should be checked by a healthcare provider. The following steps can help alleviate or treat frostbite until you can seek medical attention.</p> <ul> <li>Get the person into a warm room as soon as possible.</li> <li>Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on feet or toes that show signs of frostbite\u2014this increases the damage. Do not rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage.</li> <li>Put the areas affected by frostbite in warm\u2014not hot\u2014water (the temperature should be comfortable to the touch for unaffected parts of the body). If warm water is not available, warm the affected area using body heat. For example, you can use the heat of an armpit to warm frostbitten fingers. Do not use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Affected areas are numb and can easily burn.</li> </ul> <h2>If Conditions Worsen</h2> <p>Winter storms can decrease your ability to see as well as the ability of others to see you. If you are hiking, stop, find shelter near you, and stay put so you don\u2019t become lost. If you are driving, turn on your lights and slow down or pull over if possible.</p> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Do not walk on ski tracks. Footprints and snowshoe tracks worsen conditions for skiers and using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Yield to faster skiers and/or downhill traffic. Step to side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill.</p> </li> </ul>",
