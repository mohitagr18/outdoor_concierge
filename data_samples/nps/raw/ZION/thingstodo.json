Then, as the last sunlight fades from the sky, a steady stream of cars file out of the park toward homes, hotels, and other destinations. But for those few who stay later or spend the night nearby, an entirely different and memorable Zion experience awaits: the dark night sky, filled with thousands of stars, above the jagged silhouette of cliffs.</p> <p paraeid=\"{dca038d6-8ebe-4d0a-9077-060c966431ba}{82}\" paraid=\"5\">Zion is a great place to connect with the night sky, whether you are an avid astrophotographer or this will be your first view of the Milky Way. As an International Dark Sky Park, Zion\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/night_friendly_lighting.htm\">protects our incredible dark skies</a>\u00a0for present and future generations by not degrading the night with artificial light.

There is no formal destination, so remember to turn around before you feel tired so you can safely finish your hike the same way you came.<br /> <br /> No permit is required for this day hike, but travel beyond Big Spring and up Orderville Canyon requires a<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm\">Wilderness permit.</a><br /> <br /> Water and restrooms are available at the Temple of Sinawava.",

Most routes in the park are not recommended for inexperienced climbers due to difficulty and the soft nature of the rock. While areas outside of the park offer abundant sport climbing and top roping possibilities, this is rare in the park, with bolted routes often having sparse protection.<br /> <br /> The best conditions for climbing are from March through May and September through early November. Temperatures in the summer can soar over 100 degrees even on shaded walls. Additionally, summer months often bring monsoonal rainstorms. Unlike other rock types, desert sandstone is heavily weakened when wet. Avoid climbing in damp areas or after rainstorms. It often takes two or more days for the rock to be dry enough to climb. This means that critical holds are more likely to break, altering routes for future climbers. Additionally, climbing protection is less likely to hold resulting in greater fall distances and chance of injury. A collection of a climber-submitted topographic maps can be found at the Wilderness Desk at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. The park suggests submitting topographic maps of all first ascents in the park upon completion. This helps future generations locate climbs and provides a historical account of climbing in Zion National Park.</p> <h4><strong>Bouldering</strong></h4> <p>There are two bouldering areas in the main canyon. One is 40 yards west of the south entrance, called The Globe. This is a house sized boulder that poses a variety of options and problems. The second is Drilled Pocket Boulder, located 0.5 mile north of the south entrance. It is located on the west side of the road and is a slab with an obvious south facing crack.</p>",
