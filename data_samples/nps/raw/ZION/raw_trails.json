Along the Virgin River, the riparian area\u00a0is home to plants and animals that require an abundant supply of water. \u00a0<br /> Fremont cottonwood trees (<em>Populus fremontii</em>) require a constant source of water and thrive along the Virgin River. When Fremont cottonwoods have access to reliable water, they can grow between 10\u201320 feet per year. These trees can also be helpful for streambank protection and are able to withstand low levels of flooding.<br /> The riparian area is also the perfect habitat for the American beaver. You may not immediately think of the American beaver when in the Southwest, but the Virgin River provides a welcome habitat for this river specialist. Sightings are rare, but evidence of the beaver's activity can be seen on many of the park's Fremont cottonwood trees. They do most of their tree-chewing during the night when the cover of darkness helps them to avoid predators.\u00a0</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{73fbe6d5-2801-4581-af4e-14af52ccfaa6}{16}\" paraid=\"833899767\">Look</h3> <p>Have you seen any evidence of wildlife along the trail?

      "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide concrete path that follows the Virgin River. The side of the path facing the river is lined with a wooden, split-rail fence. The other side is open to the sandy shrubland of the South Campground. To the south, the path continues towards the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. To the north, the path continues towards Canyon Junction. Just off the path along the split-rail fence is a long sandstone bench and a hip-height metal wayside sign. A picture spans the top half of the sign showing three buck deer with large antlers grazing near a clear, slow-moving river surrounded by yellow-leaved cottonwood trees and dormant grasses and shrubs. A title in the top left corner reads, \u201cA Living Canyon.\u201d In the lower right corner of the picture, a paragraph reads, \u201cStop for a moment. What do you see, hear, and smell? Where water is abundant, plants and animals thrive. The Virgin River and the vegetation in the riparian zone along it provide habitat for many species. Away from the river the temperature increases and the humidity drops. But life is tenacious and adapts. As you stroll the Pa\u2019rus trail consider life with\u2014or without\u2014water.\u201d The bottom left corner of the sign shows a Prickly Pear Cactus (scientific name Opuntia phaecantha) with dark-green spiked flat pads and three bright-yellow blooms. \u201cThe sharp spines of a cactus are believed to have evolved from leaves and serve a dual purpose \u2013 protecting the cactus from hungry critters and limiting water loss with reduced surface area.\u201d Next to the cactus is a light-green, rounded Fremont Cottonwood leaf (scientific name Populus fremontii.) The caption reads, \u201cOn a hot summer day, the cottonwood\u2019s branches create shade and cooler temperatures. These native trees thrive where there is water and are found lining the river. They offer shelter and food to many animals and help stabilize riverbanks.\u201d At the center of the page, a 2-inch-long Virgin Spinedace fish with shiny scales is shown (scientific name Lepidomeda mollispinins). The caption reads, \u201cThis medium-sized silvery minnow was once found throughout the Virgin River. Due to habitat fragmentation, introduction of non-native species, and water demands, it is now found only in protected areas like Zion National Park. One of four native fish in the park, it is well adapted to the changing river temperatures and flood prone and sediment-laden rivers of Zion.\u201d The bottom right corner of the sign has a 4-inch-long mottled brown lizard with a blue belly standing up on its hind legs. Its long toes grip a reddish sandstone rock and its long, narrow tail hangs down. Its front feet are against a taller sandstone rock. It is identified as a Plateau Lizard (scientific name Sceloporus tristichus). The caption reads, \u201cReptiles are ectotherms (or cold-blooded) and need to soak up the sun to warm their bodies so they can scurry away from predators and after prey. Much of their hydration is obtained from the insects and spiders they consume which allows them to live away from water sources.\u201d",

The lodge has a variety of accommodations and is the only place inside Zion to eat; either in the main dining room (Red Rock Grill) or at the Castle Dome Caf\u00e9 (open seasonally). For more information about eating, visiting, or staying at the Zion Lodge, please visit their website at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zionlodge.com/\">www.zionlodge.com</a>\u00a0or call 435 772-7700.</p> <h4>Zion Lodge History</h4> <p><br /> In the early days of the National Park Service, railroad companies were often the catalyst for the creation or improvement of park accommodations. For Zion, that railroad was the Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. With the completion of a railroad spur line to nearby Cedar City in 1923, visitors now had an easy and comfortable way to get to Zion. The next step was to provide lodging that complimented the world-class scenery.<br /> <br /> While initial designs of the lodge called for enormity and immensity, park officials ultimately determined that a lodge in the narrow canyon should better harmonize with the landscape and scale of the surroundings. Gilbert Stanley Underwood \u2013 a frequent architect of numerous national park lodges \u2013 was up to the challenge. Using 265,000 board feet of lumber brought down from the plateau by the Cable Mountain Draw Works, the Utah Parks Company designed a main lodge building that was inviting and exuded warmth. The Zion Lodge was completed in May of 1925, and was later complimented with a series of stand-alone cabins nestled nearby. These improvements signaled an important milestone in a visit to Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> The main lodge building stood for over 40 years until it was consumed by a fire on January 26, 1966. A mere 108 days after the fire, a new prefabricated building was up and operating. This quick turn-around speaks volumes about the significance that the Zion Lodge had garnered in the story of Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> Whether you're looking for a shady respite from the heat or hoping to dine among a majestic backdrop, the Zion Lodge is a beautiful place to stop. Visitors can even attend\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/ranger-led-activities.htm\">ranger-led activities</a>\u00a0at the lodge, a service that started back in 1935. For many, the Zion Lodge has become a hallmark of a visit to the area, and occupies an important place in the history of Zion National Park.</p> <h4>Trails accessed from here:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>The Grotto Trail</p> </li> <li>Sand Bench Trail</li> <li>Emerald Pools Trails: Upper, Middle, and Lower Emerald Pools can all be accessed via the trailhead across the road from the Lodge</li> </ul> <h4>Shuttle Service</h4> <p>When the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm\">Zion Canyon Shuttle Bus</a>\u00a0is running, the Zion Lodge is shuttle stop #5 at the end of the canyon.\u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Lodge is located in the bottom of Zion Canyon, near the steep canyon walls that extend high above. A two story wood and stone structure with large square stone columns out front sheltering a patio with rocking chairs. The Lodge has a large lawn with a giant cottonwood tree in the middle that casts cooling shade in summer, making it a comfortable spot to relax. To the south, several other similar structures are built to house the hotel rooms and smaller rustic cabins.",

      "longDescription": "The Narrows is a strenuous hike that follows the Virgin River through a narrow slot canyon. After 1 mile (0.6 km) on the easy, paved Riverside Walk, head down a set of stairs and into the river. The rest of your hike will take place in the Virgin River, where the flow rate can change day by day and the streambed is rocky with unstable footing. Flash flooding and hypothermia are constant dangers. The hike requires wading, walking, and sometimes swimming in the river.<br /> <br /> Good planning, proper equipment, and sound judgment are essential for a safe and successful hike. There is no formal destination, so remember to turn around before you feel tired so you can safely finish your hike the same way you came.<br /> <br /> No permit is required for this day hike, but travel beyond Big Spring and up Orderville Canyon requires a<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm\">Wilderness permit.</a><br /> <br /> Water and restrooms are available at the Temple of Sinawava.",
