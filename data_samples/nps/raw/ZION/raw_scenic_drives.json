Carmel Junction\n\nThis scenic byway runs for 54 miles.\n\nTravel time is about 1.5 hours.\n\nFrom the west, you get on the byway at the intersection of Hwy 9 and Interstate 15, about 9 miles east of\u00a0[St. George](https://www.utah.com/destinations/cities-towns/st-george/). On the east, the Byway ends at Hwy 89, at Mt Carmel Junction.\n\nHwy 9 is the major road providing access to\u00a0[Zion National Park](https://www.utah.com/destinations/national-parks/zion-national-park/). It winds past the park visitor center and museum, and past many famous Zion landmarks. It provides access to Zion Canyon (accessible by shuttle only during the tourist season) and then goes through the park's mile-long tunnel. It cuts through the park's Checkerboard Mesa area and then ends at Hwy 89 at Mt Carmel Junction.\n\n**A fee is charged to drive through the park.**\n\nThe byway parallels the Virgin River in many areas. Near I-15, it provides access to Quail Creek and\u00a0[Sand Hollow](https://www.utah.com/destinations/state-parks/sand-hollow-state-park/)\u00a0Utah State Parks. It cuts through the towns of Hurricane, Virgin, Rockville, and Springdale before entering the Park.\n\nNear Rockville, it provides access to Grafton ghost town, a photogenic site that was featured prominently in the movie \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"\n\n**Large vehicles and\u00a0RVs\u00a0are required to pay an escort fee to travel through the Zion Tunnel.**\n\nYou can drive this byway as part of a loop, circling north and returning via Hwy 14 over Cedar Mountain, or circling south and returning via Hwy 89 through Kanab and Fredonia, and then Hwy 389 through Colorado City to Hurricane.\n\nMany people explore Zion Park and then drive the byway as they continue their trip, heading to Grand Canyon, Lake Powell, Bryce Canyon or other area attractions.\n\n## Location\n\n[Get Directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Current+Location/37.209817377966395,-112.95565061569214)\n\n## Zion Weather\n\n![Sunny](https://www.utah.com/build/_assets/sunny-IHYE2HG6.svg)\n\n### Current Weather - Sunny\n\n29\u00b0F\n\nLow25\u00b0F\n\n* * *\n\nJanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember\n\n### Average Temperature\n\nSun\n\n51.9\u00b0F\n\nLow29\u00b0F\n\n### Average Precipitation\n\nRainy weather icon\n\n1.67\"\n\n### Average Snowfall\n\nSnowy weather icon\n\n3.4\"\n\n## Articles\n\n[View Allarrow\\_forward](https://www.utah.com/articles)\n\nnavigate\\_next\n\n[![4 Reasons to Dump Disneyland for Zion National Park](https://ctfassets.ksldigital.com/0wjmk6wgfops/5THSx8N7JJu24chyw9YOeW/4f2a131a6673f79c570b7e8102050143/_a186486f-04bf-437d-b716-90bb2b6ae10a.4e5e2e4162.jpg?w=500&h=300&fit=thumb&q=70)](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/4-reasons-to-dump-disneyland-for-zion-national-park)\n\n### [4 Reasons to Dump Disneyland for Zion National Park](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/4-reasons-to-dump-disneyland-for-zion-national-park)\n\nZion National Park is a playground sculpted by mother nature herself \u2014 and her attractions are kille...\n\n[Read Morearrow\\_forward](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/4-reasons-to-dump-disneyland-for-zion-national-park)\n\n[![Zion is for Adventurers](https://ctfassets.ksldigital.com/0wjmk6wgfops/5yuuCZ3WjIjDZANoUlK1Bx/47daf5424eaf86f0b745891f322158a0/_94e385ae-a5e4-47f3-be14-9aa7e81294c4.fbf3111662.jpg?w=500&h=300&fit=thumb&q=70)](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/zion-weekend-adventure-itinerary)\n\n### [Zion is for Adventurers](https://www.utah.com/articles/post/zion-weekend-adventure-itinerary)\n\nFollow this itinerary for the most amazing adventure in Zion National Park.

Zion Canyon is the centerpiece and most popular part of the park. Zion Canyon was carved by the Virgin River over millions of years! You might know Zion by its bucket-list hikes \u2014 Angels Landing and the Narrows are two of the most popular \u2014 but you don't have to be an experienced hiker to soak in the epic scenery Zion has to offer. Our guide includes a day hike for everyone, whether you're looking for a family-friendly stroll along the river or a heart-pounding climb with the canyon sprawling below you.\n\nThere are 5 areas where you can hike in Zion: [Zion Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-trail-descriptions.htm), [East Rim](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/east-rim-wilderness-trail-descriptions.htm), [Kolob Canyons](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/kolob-canyons-wilderness-hiking-trails.htm), [Kolob Terrace](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/kolob-terrace-wilderness-trail-descriptions.htm), and [Southwest Desert](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/southwest-desert-wilderness-hiking-trails.htm). The most popular and easily accessible hikes are in the Zion Canyon area. The other areas are wilderness areas that offer more rugged hikes. It takes a little extra effort to travel to those areas, but the reward is fewer fellow hikers on the trail.\n\nFrom March through November, the park runs [2 free shuttle routes](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm), the Zion Canyon Line and the Springdale Line. The Zion Canyon Line operates within the park, with shuttle stops near popular trailheads. The Springdale Line operates outside the park, with stops at locations in the town of Springdale and at Zion Canyon Village. You don't need a ticket or reservation to ride the shuttles \u2014 just hop on and off at any shuttle stop. Remember that when the shuttles are in operation, you can't drive a personal vehicle along Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, but you can still drive to other areas of the park.\n\nZion is open 24 hours a day, year-round. Spring and fall are the best times to visit for the mildest weather, but the park is beautiful all year. If you visit from March through November, remember that most of the hikes in Zion Canyon are only accessible via the free park shuttle.\n\nThere is an [entrance fee](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/fees.htm) to visit Zion. You can only purchase an entrance pass in person at one of the park's entrance stations.\n\n## Top trails\n\n1. ### [\\#1 \\- Zion National Park Scenic Drive](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/zion-national-park-scenic-drive--2)\n\n\n\n[4.7(3575)\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b7Easy\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b712.4 mi\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b7Est. 4.5\u20135 hr](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/zion-national-park-scenic-drive--2 \"Zion National Park Scenic Drive\") [Short drive along the canyon floor.
