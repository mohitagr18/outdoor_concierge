The desert sand dunes that formed the Navajo Sandstone layer\u00a0contain wind-blown sand particles that have space in-between them. The ancient floodplain that formed the Kayenta layer\u00a0is a mudstone that has tightly packed together particles. Water that is absorbed at the highest points of the canyon can travel through the Navajo Sandstone, but is not able to travel through the tightly packed mudstone particles of the Kayenta layer. Where these two rock layers meet, water is forced to travel sideways\u00a0until it comes out of the rock face in the form of seeps and springs.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h3>Look</h3> <p>Do you see any evidence of seeps and springs at the boundary of the Navajo Sandstone and Kayenta layer? Cottonwood trees and other water-loving plants are a good indication of a nearby water source.\u00a0</p> <h3>Connect</h3> <p>Zion National Park is located along the edge of a region known as the Colorado Plateau. Here, the rock layers have been uplifted, tilted, and eroded, forming a feature called the Grand Staircase, a series of colorful cliffs stretching between Bryce Canyon and the Grand Canyon. Each rock layer of the Grand Staircase holds stories of ancient environments and inhabitants very different from those found here today. What stories will you uncover?\u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide, concrete path connected to a wooden shade structure with sandstone benches underneath. To the south, the path continues through desert shrubs towards the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. The sandstone Watchman formation is this way as well. To the north, the path continues to follow the Virgin River towards Canyon Junction. Also underneath the shade structure is an angled metal sign. You are standing in front of red sandstone cliffs. An image of the same cliffs fills the entire sign. At the top right, the sign is titled, \u201cChanging Landscapes.\u201d Under the title, text reads, \u201cWhere you are standing was once a tidal flat at the edge of an ocean, a massive arid desert, and a river system where dinosaurs roamed. A lot can change in 200 million years, and the sedimentary rock layers tell those stories. The presence and absence of water has shaped Zion through geologic time.\u201d An illustration on the left shows five rock layers with dashed blue lines connecting to the background image to show where each layer can be found on the cliffs around you. The youngest top layer is shown in yellow and labeled \u201cTemple Cap Formation.\u201d The rock in this layer was created 175-170 million years ago and is at the top of the highest peaks in Zion Canyon. Next down on the graphic is \u201cNavajo Sandstone\u201d represented by cream, pink, and brown sections within the layer, which was created 185-180 million years ago. An inset picture shows large hills of tan sand with the caption, \u201cDesert sand dunes formed the Navajo Sandstone Layer.\u201d This layer forms the sheer multi-colored cliffs seen in the background image. Below the \"Navajo Sandstone\u201d layer is the \u201dKayenta Formation\u201d. This layer was deposited 195-185 million years ago, when dinosaurs lived here. Footprints of prehistoric creatures are illustrated within this brown layer on the graphic. The blue dashed line links this formation to the section of junipers below the vertical Navajo Sandstone cliffs. \u201cSpringdale Sandstone\u201d is a subpart of the Kayenta Formation and makes up the smaller cliffs below the vegetated slopes of the Kayenta Formation. The Moenave Formation is the fourth section from the top and is represented by a rust-colored layer. It was created 210-195 million years ago and has dinosaur footprints and a fish skeleton in the graphic to represent the prehistoric animals that lived here. A photograph to the left side of the graphic spanning the Kayenta and Moenave layers shows a river system and floodplain. The picture is inset with an image of a person\u2019s hand next to a three-toed grey fossilized footprint that is twice as large as the hand. The caption below says this type of landscape provided habitat for dinosaurs in the Kayenta and Moenave layers. Additional portions of the graphic are faded out to show that some layers in Zion are not visible in the cliffs around you. Older layers below the Moenave layer are not yet exposed in the main part of Zion Canyon, and younger layers above the Temple Cap Formation have already eroded completely from the Main Canyon. A quote by Heraclitus sits in the corner of the sign and reads, \u201cChange is the only constant in time.\u201d",

The river drops roughly 7,800 feet in the 160 miles it travels. In the park, the river drops an average of 71 feet every mile. In comparison, the Mississippi River drops about one inch every mile. This steepness, caused by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, has given the Virgin River the ability to cut through sandstone and carve canyons.\u00a0</p> <h3>Look</h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{75f09f85-8dff-40ae-830d-60e08ccbd3ad}{3}\" paraid=\"593015807\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">When you look at the river is the water clear?

A bright-blue sky filled with fluffy clouds is above. In the foreground is the Virgin River with still blue water. A tall cottonwood tree stands about 15 feet from the river\u2019s edge up a slight slope. In this picture, the river is running at 128 cubic feet per second. A smaller picture to the left shows the same view, but the sky is dark with storm clouds looming behind the cliffs. A muddy and turbulent Virgin River flows right up to the base of same cottonwood tree, showing how wide the river\u2019s path becomes when the river flows at 3,970 cubic feet per second. Text on the sign\u2019s right side reads, \u201cWhat made a young canyon in old rock? Sediment carried in the water gives rivers power to carve down and through soft rocks. The canyon you see today was carved by the Virgin River and its tributaries in the past 2 million years, exposing rock layers nearly 200 million years old.\u201d At the bottom of the sign, the text reads, \u201cThe Virgin River\u2019s power becomes apparent when it floods. During times of low flow, the small river may flow at 25 cubic feet/second or less. In flood season the river may rise to 4,000 cubic feet/second or more. The force of the water rips trees from riverbanks, moves tons of sediment, and sends huge boulders tumbling downstream, creating a vast and dangerous path of destruction. But in destruction there is creation. New habitat is formed, soils are redistributed, and old materials are washed away. Can you see evidence of flooding? Look for plant debris suspended high above the river\u2019s current level, logs on gravel bars, or fresh deposits of mud and sand as you continue along the trail.\u201d",

      "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide, concrete path that follows the Virgin River winds through desert sand and shrubs. To the south, the path extends towards the South Campground and Zion Canyon Visitor Center. In the distance, the large, triangular sandstone formation known as the Watchman is visible. To the north, the path continues through desert shrubs to Canyon Junction. Connected to the path where you are standing is a wooden shade structure standing over a wide sandstone bench and an angled wayside sign. An historic black-and-white photo takes up two-thirds of the right side of the sign. In the picture, the cliffs of Zion tower above three small, rustic wooden structures and a wagon. A larger light-colored building can be seen in the background. Cursive handwriting at the bottom of the image identifies it as the Crawford Homestead looking south. A title at the top right of the image reads, \u201cFootprints in Time.\u201d Underneath the image, text says, \u201cHumans have survived and adapted in the Zion area for over 15,000 years. The waters of the Virgin River have provided sustenance for different cultures through time under the towering red rock cliffs. Though the people have changed, the landscape and the nourishing water remain constant.\u201d The left third of the sign has a vertical timeline. At the top is a picture of two rough-edged white stone arrowheads lying on red sand. The image is labeled \u201cArchaic People: 13,000 Before Common Era to 0 Common Era. The Archaic people were hunter-gatherers who left behind spear points, knives and other stone tools.\u201d Next in the timeline is a picture of an 8-foot-square sandstone structure without a roof nestled in an alcove on a cliff. It is labeled, \u201cAncestral Puebloan and Fremont Peoples: 1 Common Era to 1150 Common Era. These people were cultivators who built permanent communities with homes and granaries.\u201d At the center of the timeline is a black-and-white picture of a large gathering of Southern Paiute adults and children kneeling and standing around an open patch of ground. One person is gesturing as if telling a story to the group. The timeline reads, \u201cSouthern Paiute: 1150 Common Era to present. The Southern Paiute people were farmers, hunters and gatherers who shared traditions through dances and storytelling. Today, they combine old ways with new and maintain connection to their native homeland.\u201d The fourth picture in the timeline is a black \u2013and-white picture of two horse-drawn wagons with large wooden-spoked wheels carrying corn stalks. Men, women, and children are gathered around and on the wagons. The caption reads, \u201cEuro-Americans Settlers: 1860 to 1909. Mormon pioneers came west in search of sanctuary and built settlements near water. Remnants of irrigation ditches are still visible.\u201d At the bottom of the timeline, a brightly colorized historic photo shows a dirt road with large sandstone masonry monuments on either side. The monument on the left side of the road is about 5 feet high while the monument on the right is twice as large with a \u201cZion National Park\u201d sign hanging from a horizontal log pole near the top. In the background, towering red-and-white sandstone cliffs are set against a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. It is identified as the South Entrance to Zion and represents the timeline from 1909 to the present. The area was designated as \u201cMukuntuweap National Monument in 1909 then Zion National Park in 1919. Each visitor writes their own story of Zion.\u201d",

Erosion and weathering also play a role forming natural arches in the park. A natural arch is formed when deep cracks penetrate into a layer of sandstone. Erosion wears away the exposed rock layers and\u00a0surface cracks expand, isolating narrow sandstone walls, called \"fins\". Water, frost, and the release of tensions in the rock cause crumbling and flaking of the porous sandstone, eventually cutting through some of these fins. The resulting holes become enlarged to arch proportions by rockfalls and weathering.<br /> Architecturally, arches are the most stable load bearing structure, but through weathering, eventually all arches collapse, leaving only buttresses that will inevitably\u00a0give way to the unyielding forces of erosion.\u00a0</p> <h3>Look</h3> <p>Among the arches in Zion, one of the most visible is the Crawford Arch. It can be seen from the Pa\u2019rus Trail on Bridge Mountain, a thousand feet above the canyon floor. Bridge Mountain is located on the east side of the canyon\u00a0and is one of the tallest peaks along the trail. Once you locate the peak, follow the left edge down to where it intersects with the other peak. From the intersection\u00a0follow the small line of trees\u00a0to the right.

A photograph taken within a narrow canyon spans the sign. The canyon\u2019s smooth sandstone walls extend up and out of the picture. A peaceful Virgin River covers the canyon floor. A title in the top left corner reads, \u201cThe Master Sculptor.\u201d Underneath the title, text says, \u201cWhile the Virgin River carved the depth of the canyon, the work of rain and ice helped sculpt the wide canyon surrounding you now. Erosion and weather are natural geologic processes that shape the surface of the earth. Can you see evidence of their power in the landscape around you?\u201d At the bottom of the sign, a quote from Henry David Thoreau reads, \u201cThe finest workers of stone are not copper or steel tools, but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time.\u201d Four graphics on the sign\u2019s right side depict the four stages of how canyons are created by layers of sediment slowly being carved down by the river and widened by freeze-thaw cycles and gravity. The top graphic shows red, cream, and pink layers of sediment with remnants of dinosaur bones and seashells representing the layers found in Zion Canyon. It is captioned, \u201cSediment layers are deposited over millions of years.\u201d The second graphic shows the same layers but with an inverted-triangular section in the middle removed. A blue line across the bottom of the new canyon represents the Virgin River, which is implied to have eroded away the layers of sediment. The canyon walls are rugged, showing how various layers erode differently. A caption reads, \u201cThe Virgin River and its tributaries carve the depth of the canyon. Mudstone and siltstone erode more readily than sandstone.\u201d The third graphic shows the eroded layers like the second graphic above, but with snow and rain droplets falling into small cracks in the top layer and freezing. The caption reads, \u201cZion only receives about 16\u201d of rain annually, but that is enough to seep into cracks in rock layers. Winter freeze and thaw cycles cause the cracks to expand.\u201d The bottom graphic shows the effects of this ice wedging. The jagged outcroppings shown in previous graphics have now fallen into the canyon below and the canyon walls are smoother. It is captioned, \u201cGravity causes the undercut rocks to fall from the steep cliffs; additional sediment is washed away.\u201d",

Examples include, but are not limited to, bolts, pitons, and webbing. Only place fixed anchors as a last resort. Before placing fixed anchors on a route, think seriously about whether the route warrants them. All bolts must be placed using a hand drill only.

Most routes in the park are not recommended for inexperienced climbers due to difficulty and the soft nature of the rock. While areas outside of the park offer abundant sport climbing and top roping possibilities, this is rare in the park, with bolted routes often having sparse protection.<br /> <br /> The best conditions for climbing are from March through May and September through early November. Temperatures in the summer can soar over 100 degrees even on shaded walls. Additionally, summer months often bring monsoonal rainstorms. Unlike other rock types, desert sandstone is heavily weakened when wet. Avoid climbing in damp areas or after rainstorms. It often takes two or more days for the rock to be dry enough to climb. This means that critical holds are more likely to break, altering routes for future climbers. Additionally, climbing protection is less likely to hold resulting in greater fall distances and chance of injury. A collection of a climber-submitted topographic maps can be found at the Wilderness Desk at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. The park suggests submitting topographic maps of all first ascents in the park upon completion. This helps future generations locate climbs and provides a historical account of climbing in Zion National Park.</p> <h4><strong>Bouldering</strong></h4> <p>There are two bouldering areas in the main canyon. One is 40 yards west of the south entrance, called The Globe. This is a house sized boulder that poses a variety of options and problems. The second is Drilled Pocket Boulder, located 0.5 mile north of the south entrance. It is located on the west side of the road and is a slab with an obvious south facing crack.</p>",
