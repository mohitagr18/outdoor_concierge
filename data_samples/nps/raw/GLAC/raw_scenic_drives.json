It stretches over 50 miles through some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in North America, treating visitors to breathtaking views of glacier-carved peaks, emerald-blue alpine lakes, and lush forests.\n\nDetails\n\n[Duration\\\\\n\\\\\n3-8 Hours](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--0)\n\nDriving Going-to-the-Sun Road can take just a few hours, or you might spend all day enjoying the views. For safety reasons, 45 miles per hour is the speed limit in the lower elevations of the road and 25 miles per hour in the alpine section.\n\nActivity\n\nScenic Driving\n\n[Pets Allowed\\\\\n\\\\\nYes](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--3)\n\nPets are allowed in developed areas (e.g. parking lots, along roads) but are not allowed on trails. Pets must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet (1.8 m), under physical restraint, or caged at all times, including while in open-bed pickup trucks.\n\n[Activity Fee\\\\\n\\\\\nNo](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--4)\n\nNo additional fee\n\n[Reservations\\\\\n\\\\\nYes](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--6)\n\nVehicle reservations are needed for personal vehicles and motorcycles at certain times of the year. To learn more about vehicle reservations for the Going-to-the-Sun Road and other areas of the park, visit our [vehicle reservations](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/vehicle-reservations.htm) page.\u00a0Reservations are not required to take the park shuttle.\n\n[Season\\\\\n\\\\\nSummer](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--7)\n\nThough portions of Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open year round, seasonal conditions (snow!) mean a drive across the whole road is only possible during summer months. Check Glacier\u2019s [Road Status](https://www.nps.gov/applications/glac/roadstatus/roadstatus.cfm) page before your trip.\n\n[Time of Day\\\\\n\\\\\nAny Time](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-gtsr.htm#InfoAccordian__Item__Description--8)\n\nWe suggest arriving early or staying late if you want to find parking at Logan Pass. Be extremely cautious driving at night; visibility is low and\u00a0wildlife may be numerous.\n\nAccessibility Information\n\n- Going-to-the-Sun Road is fully paved, with numerous pullouts along the journey (some with informative signage, some with trails of varying accessibility) that allow for self-paced travel.\n\n- Both concessionaire bus tours (Sun Tours and the historic Red Buses) and Glacier\u2019s own Going-to-the-Sun Road Shuttle System have ADA accessible vehicles.\n\n- The highest point reached is Logan Pass, 6,646 ft (2,025 m) in elevation.\n\n- There is a Going-to-the-Sun Road Audio Tour available for download, which provides commentary at various stops and features along the road.\n\n[Glacier National Park](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/things2do.htm)\n\n## Tags\n\n- [glacier national park](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#fq[]=Sites_Item:%22Glacier+National+Park%22)\n- [scenic drive](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=Scenic+Drive)\n- [going-to-the-sun road](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=Going-to-the-sun+road)\n- [going to the sun road](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=Going+to+the+Sun+Road)\n- [montana](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=Montana)\n- [logan pass](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=logan+pass)\n- [driving](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=driving)\n- [tour](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=tour)\n- [road](https://www.nps.gov/media/article-search.htm#q=Road)\n\n![Antique car on road, dwarfed by mountain vista](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/images/Do_Drive_GTSR_JF_2.jpg?maxwidth=1300&autorotate=false)Take in views of glacially sculpted mountains and valleys\n\nNPS/Jacob W. Frank\n\nA trip across Going-to-the-Sun Road is a trip into the heart of Glacier. This \u201ctransmountain highway\u201d offers exceptional views at every turn. The road stretches about 50 miles between the West Entrance and St. Mary Entrance, and climbs to 6,466 ft (2,025 m) at Logan Pass. There are numerous stopping points along the road. Highlights include Lake McDonald Lodge, short hikes like Trail of the Cedars or St. Mary Falls, Logan Pass Visitor Center, and the many informative wayside signs that explain features and track your journey.\n\n**There are multiple ways to travel:**\n\n- Drive a personal vehicle. Be aware there are size restrictions. Vehicles, and vehicle combinations, longer than 21 feet (including bumpers) or wider than 8 feet (including mirrors), are prohibited between Avalanche Campground and the Rising Sun picnic area parking.\n- Take the free [Glacier Shuttle System](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/shuttles.htm) that runs two-way service between Apgar Visitor Center and St. Mary Visitor Center.\n- Book a [tour](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/bus-tours.htm) with commentary with either park concessionaire, Sun Tours or historic Red Buses.\n\n* * *\n\nExplore the [Going-to-the-Sun Road](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/goingtothesunroad.htm) pages on Glacier's website for further information about the shuttle, audio tours, road status, and more.\n\n* * *\n\nStop along your journey and stretch your legs on a short trail.
