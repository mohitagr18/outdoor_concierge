Any disturbance\u2014whether that\u2019s a fire, an avalanche, a landslide, or a pest outbreak\u2014resets the ecological clock. The mature trees die, opening the canopy to light and making way for new species to take hold. Gradually, the new forest matures\u2014this is called ecological succession. Fire is unique because it favors certain species to grow back.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As you hike, look for pink fireweed and other wildflowers that reseed an area after a fire. Beargrass, which is a small grassy tuft with a tall, white, Dr. Seuss-like flower, easily resprouts from its roots after a burn.\u00a0<br /> <br /> If you\u2019re here in the fall, keep an eye out for larch trees\u2014they look like evergreens, but their needles turn bright golden in October and November. Their thick bark helps mature trees survive a fire when other trees may not. Afterward, their tiny wind-blown seeds shower across the burned area, planting thousands of new larch trees.<br /> <br /> This area burned in 1926, in 1967, and in 2001\u2014relatively short intervals for a cool, wet place like Glacier. Learn more about how our forests are responding to more frequent fires in an episode of Glacier\u2019s podcast, Headwaters.

The variations in elevation\u00a0between the park\u2019s high peaks and valley bottoms contribute to diverse habitats supporting thousands of plants and animals, including rare and threatened species.
