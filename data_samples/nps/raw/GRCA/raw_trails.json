      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 2, Angels Window. 2 minutes. About halfway along the paved Cape Royal Trail from the parking area, a second paved trail leads left (east) to an observation platform, and an unpaved trail along the top of Angel\u2019s Window. The Angels Window trail leads down a slight slope to a fork. Take the left fork to continue along a slightly narrower path that curves around to the right to a paved, stone-lined observation platform, 15 feet (five meters) wide by 10 feet (three meters) deep. To the left is the towering Vishnu Temple. To the right, the massive, curved walls and flat top of Wotans Throne. Two, three-foot tall wayside panels mounted on angled, metal reading rails stand side by side along the canyon side of the platform. The left-hand panel describes the changing colors of the Colorado River. The right-hand panel encourages you to listen to the sounds of the canyon. Descriptions of these two panels are included in the sub-script below. Note a wooden park bench in a small grove of trees at the far, right-hand side of the platform. Be mindful of the rocky platform border when moving to the bench. Moving back up the trail from the observation platform to the fork, a second asphalt trail to the left slopes down about 20 feet (six meters) to set of uneven stone steps and a dirt and gravel trail. The uneven dirt trail winds further down among a series of large boulders, then moves down three more stone steps to a path along the edge of the canyon. Four-foot tall metal guardrails flank the trail on either side. Note the path narrows as it crosses onto the top of Angel\u2019s Window itself. The path continues east to a large, rocky expanse on top of the rock formation, 50 feet (15 meters) long by 25 feet (eight meters) wide, with metal guardrails all around. The River Red Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon with a view of the winding, reddish brown Colorado River at the bottom fills the face of the first wayside panel at the left. Entitled \u201cThe River Red,\u201d words at the top of the panel read: Is the Colorado River clear, rusty brown, or emerald green today? Before the 1963 construction of Glen Canyon Dam just upstream of Grand Canyon, the river flowed a sediment-filled red and was called \u201cthe river colored red\u201d, or Rio Colorado. It was described as \u201ctoo thick to drink, and too thin to plow.\u201d Sediments act as liquid sandpaper, carving the canyon, but that effect is now drastically curtailed. The clear green water that flows through Grand Canyon today is sediment-starved. The sediment is choked back by the dam and deposited in Lake Powell. It is only after spring snowmelt or when the summer monsoons arrive that the river flows red (like photo below), as side streams flush sediment into the Colorado. The first of two inset color photographs at the left shows a large dam on the river, nestled between high rock walls at the left and right. A caption reads: Glen Canyon Dam stifles the cutting and scouring power of the Colorado River. The cold, clear water discharged from the dam has drastically altered the ecology of the river, forever changing the web of life. The second, circular color photograph shows an emerald green segment of the Colorado River, with a diagonal line pointing from the river in the inset photograph to the river in the main panel photograph. A caption reads: Today\u2019s sediment-starved river erodes rather than replaces beaches. Listen Wayside Panel At top of the second wayside panel at the right, text reads: Listen Stand still, be quiet, close your eyes. . .what do you hear? Is it a natural or human-caused sound? Can you hear a distant Colorado River rapid roar? Is something else masking its sound? Is one sound more desirable or more soothing? What value do you place on the sound of falling rain or the wing beat of a passing raven? National parks allow us to enjoy landscapes and soundscapes. But natural sounds are slowly and incrementally being covered up by noises that did not exist in parks until recently. Park managers must limit the array of mechanized disturbances that encroach upon the acoustic values of the park. Hearing is the only option for experiencing certain aspects of Grand Canyon\u2014whistling canyon winds, howling coyotes, its immense quiet. Without limits on human noises, would your Grand Canyon visit be diminished? A series of three color photographs fills the left side of the panel. At the top, the first photograph shows a bright white lightning strike above a cloudy, blue-tinged view of the canyon. Questions read: \u201cWhat value do you place on the sound of thunder? On quiet?\u201d At the middle left, a waterfall cascades between some rocks, splashing into a green pool below. Text reads, \u201cNatural sounds have powerful effects on our emotions, attitudes, and memories.\u201d At the bottom left, a lone hiker stands in silhouette against a sun-drenched rock wall. Words read, \u201cThe quieter a place is, the more sensitive we become to human-caused noises. What can you do to lessen your noise?\u201d A panoramic view of the canyon fills the right side of the panel, with a black bird soaring high overhead. Words read, \u201cListen for the wing beat of a passing raven.\u201d",

The Bridle Path begins above the parking lot for the North Kaibab Trailhead, located along the east side Route 67, a little over two miles (three and a half kilometers) north of Grand Canyon Lodge. Two wildlife-proof metal garbage cans and bicycle rack stand at the foot of a one-way road that loops right uphill around a long, slender lot with diagonal parking spaces. Note at the top of the lot, there is a wheelchair accessible vault toilet, and another wildlife-proof metal garbage can. From a horse pen above the lot, a long, wood-post lined path leads downhill from the pen, alongside and parallel to the long south side of the lot. It emerges at the North Kaibab trailhead beside the water filling station, at the base of a stone staircase. The Bridle Path continues alongside the roadway to the west, connecting the North Kaibab Trailhead with the Backcountry Information Center, North Rim Campground, and Grand Canyon Lodge.

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 24, Bright Angel Point. 1 minute. From A D Stop 23, the asphalt path to Bright Angel Point continues about a quarter mile (400 meters) east. Note the paved path becomes increasingly steep, and there are no guardrails along the path to Bright Angel Point. The paved Bright Angel Point Trail leads out the spine of the ridge to Bright Angel Point. This trail is steep in places, with drop-offs and stairs, and provides dramatic views into Roaring Springs and Bright Angel Canyons. At the end of the trail is a narrow overlook, surrounded by four-foot (one meter) tall metal railings. A three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail stands at the edge of the rim at the far end of the overlook. Entitled \u201cBreaking Ground,\u201d the panel discusses the fracturing that created Bright Angel fault. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Breaking Ground Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon view from this location at Bright Angel Point fills the panel. At the top left, words read: Breaking Ground Look down Bright Angel Canyon where North Kaibab Trail winds. The Earth\u2019s crust fractured in this area, lifting one side of the rock layers and lowering the other, creating a fault. The trail follows this fault into the canyon. Water also follows the fault. Springs, like Roaring Springs, are able to flow because the groundwater has reached impermeable rock, where it spreads out sideways and leaks out of the canyon walls as springs. At the left, a white label and line indicate the location of Walhalla Plateau. At the bottom center, a second white label points out Bright Angel Fault. The deep fault continues to the right, all the way to a third label at the right of the panel, Phantom Ranch. At the right, an inset color illustration shows a cross-section of the canyon, with the fault in the middle. A caption reads: Sixty million years ago the west side of Bright Angel Fault was lifted higher than the east side.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 21, Bright Angel Point Amphitheater + Wayside. 1 minute. The Ranger talk area is located to the southeast of Grand Canyon Lodge along the Bright Angel Point trail. From a position along the access ramp at the back of the lodge complex, move about 250 feet (75 meters) east away from the lodge complex along a concrete sidewalk. Continue past several cabins at the left and right, and through a small grove of ponderosa pine, to where the pavement changes from concrete to asphalt. Continue about 75 feet (23 meters) to a number of wooden benches arranged in a semi-circle at the left. A wooden sign at the left tells us that during the season, ranger programs are held here daily. At the far side of the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the right, a mere 10 feet (three meters) from the rim, talks about how the different horizontal layers of the canyon were formed. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cLayered Environments,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Layered Environments Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon from this vantage point fills the left side of the panel. Words at the top left read: Layered Environments Tropical seas, coastal beaches, sand dunes, swamps, lagoons, and Sahara-like deserts are encapsulated within the horizontal layers that fill the view. The upper five layers of prominently stacked rocks record 70 million years of rising and falling sea levels. The limestone layers equate to shallow sea environments, sandstone layers mean sandy beaches or dunes, while shale layers translate to mud flats, swamps, or coastal plains. How do we know all this? The rocks tell us, through their fossils, mineral grains, and structures. Beneath the text, white lettering and lines point to the different formations. Top to bottom on the image, there is Kaibab limestone, the Toroweap Formation, Coconino Sandstone, the Hermit Formation, and the Supai Group. At the right, several color illustrations depict the environments that gave rise to these formations, in that same order. At the top, a shark and other ancient sea creatures swim in an ocean, above many plants and shelled creatures on the seabed. Text reads: The Kaibab sea advanced as far as modern-day eastern Arizona, depositing marine fossils including crinoids, shells, and shark\u2019s teeth. A mix of beach (sandstone) and sea (limestone) environments were embedded in the Toroweap, indicating a short advance and retreat of the sea. In the second image, a reptilian creature slithers across wide sand dunes. Text reads: Crossbed sands in the Coconino Sandstone depict scenes of shifting sand dunes, where reptiles left their tracks. In a third image, large animals, insects, and plants thrive by a marshy lake. Words read: The Hermit Formation was once a broad coastal plain evidenced by deposits of silt, mud, and fine-grain sand with an abundance of fern and animal track fossils. The last image at the bottom right depicts a wide expanse of shallow pools and plants across a sandy landscape. Words read: The Supai Group\u2019s mix of shale, siltstone, sandstone, and limestone represents a period of rapidly changing coastlines and rising and falling sea levels. A quote from John Strong Newberry at the bottom left reads: Nowhere on the earth\u2019s surface . . . are the secrets of its structure so revealed as here. A D Stop 22, Wayside 1 \u2013 On path to Bright Angel Point. \u00bd minute. About 75 feet (23 meters) east along the asphalt path from the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, the path turns right down an increasing decline. About 40 feet (12 meters) further along, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the left discusses where the drinking water in the canyon comes from. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cDrink in the View,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Drink in the View Wayside Panel A color photograph of a tall, rocky cliff with a gushing stream of water falling from its base fills the right side of the panel. Text at the top left reads: Drink in the View You have reached a special view, overlooking Roaring Springs Canyon. Drink in the canyon view here\u2014literally. Roaring Springs provides drinking water for both the North and South rims. If you fill your bottle at the lodge or campground, you are drinking Roaring Springs water. At the left, the first of three, circular, inset color photographs shows the rim of the canyon covered in snow. Text reads: Because the North Rim is higher than the South Rim, it receives more precipitation, particularly snowfall. As the snow melts water seeps into the ground. The second inset color photograph shows a stream of water rushing down a rocky, green slope. A caption reads: Some of the water moves quickly through cracks in the rock to the Roaring Springs aquifer, a natural holding tank. In the third inset photograph at the bottom left, water drips into a rocky pool. A caption reads: Some water moves through tight fractures or pores in the rock layers, taking longer paths to reach the spring\u2019s aquifer. At the top right, a final, color inset photographs shows a view of Grand Canyon Lodge from below, next to an image of a gushing water spigot. A caption reads: Water is tapped at Roaring Springs and pumped to the North and South rims. A D Stop 23, Wayside 2 \u2013 On path to Bright Angel Point. \u00bd minute. Continuing along the asphalt path toward Bright Angel Point, about 60 feet (18 meters) beyond A D stop 22, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the edge of the rim at the right discusses where the air quality in the canyon. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cHow\u2019s the View,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script How\u2019s the View Wayside Panel Two horizontal, color photographs of the same canyon view split the panel into top and bottom halves. In the top photograph, distant mountain ridges at the left, labeled \u2018San Francisco Peaks,\u2019 are visible above the canyon rim. Haze obscures the peaks in the bottom photograph. Words at the top left read: How\u2019s the View? If you are standing here in summer, your view of the San Francisco Peaks is probably hazy. The air pollutants that cause haze can be from local forest fires, but usually they are from distant urban and industrial areas hundreds of miles to the south and west. Because views are so essential to enjoying Grand Canyon, the park has been monitoring visibility since the 1970s. The good news is that the park\u2019s clearest days have gotten clearer in recent years. The bad news is that the haziest days have stayed about the same. An inset map at the top right shows Grand Canyon National Park in the center, with two large, brown arrows pointing up to the canyon from the south. A caption reads: Since most of Grand Canyon\u2019s air pollution comes from distant sources, the National Park Service works with states and tribes to help clear the air there and here. A caption at the bottom right of the top photograph reads: Air pollution affects your canyon experience; the more haze in the air the less vivid Grand Canyon\u2019s colors and forms. A caption at the bottom right of the bottom photograph reads: Pollution-caused haze can get so bad that on some days you can barely see the San Francisco Peaks, 66 miles (106 km) away.",

Before you hike, check at the Visitor Center or Backcountry Information Center for water status on the trail - or visit the <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a></strong> webpage - or scen the QR code at the trailhead.<br /> <br /> Even though the Bright Angel Trail has water stations along the trail, carrying your own water is still necessary. Water from natural\u00a0sources such as creeks and springs should be purified. When hiking in a group, each person should be carrying water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Bright Angel Trail is considered the most popular hiking trail in the park. Well-maintained and graded for stock, it is fairly easy to walk down. This can be a blessing or a curse. Wide views of the inner canyon and distant formations often distract hikers from just\u00a0how far down the trail they've walked. The return hike back up and out of the canyon is far more difficult and requires much more\u00a0effort. Plan for at least twice as much time back up as it took to go down.<br /> <br /> While South Kaibab Trail follows a ridge line, Bright Angel Trail is tucked deep within a\u00a0side canyon along a massive fault, which keeps the trail in\u00a0this side canyon for\u00a0the first few miles. The majority of the trail's elevation change takes place\u00a0in the upper four miles via a series of switchbacks that seem endless. Views are framed by massive cliffs, with more plant and animal life thanks to a higher degree of shade and natural water sources. If you're interested in geology or wildlife, this is a trail with complementary features. You can expect to see mules on the trail\u00a0as well. See below for more information.<br /> <br /> The trail levels out as it approaches Havasupai Gardens, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and over 2,000 vertical feet (925 meters) below the rim. This destination is an oasis within\u00a0the canyon, home to\u00a0the Havasupai\u00a0People until they were forced to leave when the National Park was established. From here, you might consider the relatively flat (but very exposed) 3-mile (4.8-km) round trip hike to Plateau Point for sunrise or sunset.<br /> <br /> Hikers interested in planning a trip beyond these destinations should consult a park ranger.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> During late fall, winter, and early spring, temperatures regularly\u00a0drop below freezing, and upper portions of this steep trail can become dangerously icy. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended during these times of year. Consult a park ranger for current trail conditions.<br /> <br /> Before heading down into the canyon, <strong>consult the signs at the trailhead</strong> for trip planning and <strong>current weather, trail information and trail closures</strong>. (or visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a> webpage).<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> Before your hike, it is critical to determine\u00a0your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and even death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the directions of\u00a0the wranglers.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for all\u00a0camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and how to apply <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online</a></strong>, or talk with a ranger\u00a0at the Backcountry Information Center, if you are visiting the South Rim.</p> <ul> <li>Only camp in designated campsites - <strong>Havasupai Gardens Campground</strong> offers 15 small group sites and 1 large group site.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><strong>CLOSED:</strong> <strong>Bright Angel Campground</strong>,\u00a0located on the north side of the Colorado River at Phantom Ranch, offers 30 small group sites and 2 large group sites.\u00a0<strong>On November 1, 2025, Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Campground are tentatively expected to reopen to the public. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/south-rim-corridor-trails-partially-reopened.htm\">Details</a></strong></li> </ul>",
      "audioDescription": "At the top left of a vertical wayside panel at the Bright Angel trailhead, a black and red circle surrounds a black-and-white image of Grand Canyon with large white letters urging you to, \"Hike Smart.\" Text reads: \"Welcome to Bright Angel Trail.

      "audioDescription": "A large, 200-foot (60 m) wide by 100-foot (30 m) deep courtyard surrounds the Bright Angel Trailhead along the rim. Two sets of accessible bathrooms at the back of the courtyard face north toward a wide-open concrete plaza, with a water bottle filling station at the right. Limestone boulders ring a couple garden areas in the center of the plaza, each with a stone bench under tall shade awnings. 30 feet (9 m) west down a slight incline from the water station, 18 stone pylons, each 3 feet (1m) square by four feet (1.2 m) tall with metal pipe suspended between them, ring a low stone wall surrounding a 100-foot (30 m) diameter oval-shaped mule corral. 50 feet (15 m) east of the corral up a slight incline along the rim, an 18-inch (46 cm) circular bronze plaque embedded in a roughly 4 foot (1.2 m) tall triangular-shaped limestone boulder commemorates the 2013 dedication of the Bright Angel Trailhead renovation. Text reads: \"The Bright Angel Trailhead was renovated with gifts from Grand Canyon Association donors in partnership with the National Park Service.\" A list of major supporters follows. Text at the bottom of the plaque reads: \"Additional support was provided through your park entrance fees.\" A water filling station is located just to the west of the public restroom building in the Bright Angel Trail courtyard area. Mounted on a 6foot (2 m) wide by 4 foot (1.2 m) deep limestone brick base, 3 metal spigots stick out from the center of a 4 foot (1.2 m) square panel, housed in a metal frame topped with a short, sloped metal roof. Across a full-panel color photograph of the canyon, text at the top of the panel reads: \"Grand Canyon Spring Water. Fill Your Bottles Here for Free. The Grand Canyon is a place of pristine, almost unimaginable beauty. The park is dedicated to protecting the canyon and its resources for all to enjoy. Today and into the future, there is a way you can help. Before purchasing a disposable plastic bottle of water, consider this: these bottles clog landfills and litter the park. Wind carries them over the rim and into the canyon. Water filling stations, providing free, pure Grand Canyon spring water straight from Roaring Springs below the North Rim are located throughout the park. Fill up, drink up and enjoy!\" Note the spigot at the lower left of the panel is for winter use only. It is operated with a push button, located just to the right of the spigot on the face of the panel. A picture at the top right shows a small stream cascading over limestone rocks into a swirling pool of water. Text continues: \"Refill your bottles here and enjoy pure, clean Grand Canyon spring water.\" At the bottom right, the words, \"Junior Ranger\" appear in a green circle surrounding a park ranger hat. Text continues: \"Kids, did you know... The average American uses 167 water bottles a year; A bottle of water costs about $2 (that's $334 per year); Refillable water bottles look cool and are great souvenirs. Take them home and use them again and again!\" Note these filling stations are located throughout the park at hotels, visitor centers, markets, and major trailheads, and provide free Grand Canyon spring water for all visitors.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 1, Cape Royal. 4 minutes. The parking lot for Cape Royal is located about one and a half miles (two point four kilometers) south of Walhalla Overlook, at the end of Cape Royal Road. Note an accessible parking area along the left (east) side of the multi-lane lot. Also note a wheelchair accessible vault toilet along the north side of the lot. Beside the accessible parking spaces, the paved, six-foot wide Cape Royal Trail leads east towards the rim, flanked by two wildlife-proof, metal garbage containers. The flat, paved trail, lined with stones on either side, leads about four-tenths of a mile (650 meters) to the point at Cape Royal. Note a wide variety of plants and trees growing along the sides of the trail. Pinyon pine is recognized by its short needles which typically grow in bundles of twos; cliffrose by its cream-colored blossoms and sweet fragrance throughout the summer; Utah Juniper trees by their scraggly bare trunks and bluish berries; and sagebrush with small blue-gray leaves with a strong sage aroma. Moving along the trail, the natural arch of Angel's Window to your left (east) frames the sweeping turn of the Colorado River at the Unkar Delta. About halfway along the path, a smaller paved path to the left leads to a trail along the top of Angel\u2019s Window. About 150 feet (45 meters) before reaching the point at Cape Royal, a three-foot wide paved trail leads left (east) down a slight slope to a rocky overlook. Note at the end of this short trail, two uneven stone steps lead down onto a wide, open area with loose dirt and rocks. Moving east, a series of uneven, rocky ledges step down to an overlook at the rim. Note there are no guardrails or railings here. Continuing south along the main path, at the top of the point overlook area, the pavement forks in two around some boulders in the middle of the path. About 35 feet (10 meters) forward, the paths converge, sloping gently downward. The path forks again around more boulders in the middle, leading about 60 feet (18 meters) south to a roughly 15 foot (five meter) wide curved, paved overlook area at the point. Metal railings line the rim along the second path and the whole overlook area. Stunning bands of color, deep gorges, and towering buttes are revealed. Situated one mile immediately to the southwest, the wooded top of Wotans Throne, composed of thick limestone over top a layer of cream-colored, cliff-forming sandstone, rises 5,200 feet (1,585 meters) above the Colorado River, over 7,700 feet (2,300 meters) above sea level. About two miles (three point two kilometers) east-southeast of Wotans Throne is Vishnu Temple. Also composed of cream-colored, cliff-forming sandstone with a limestone cupola caprock, it rises over just over 7,500 feet (nearly 2,300 meters) high. Three wayside panels along the rails at the rim discuss the differences in water erosion on the north versus the south rim, how the impressive Vishnu Temple and Wotan\u2019s Throne rock temples located here were formed, and how cold air can trap haze layers in the canyon. Descriptions of these three wayside panels are included in the sub-script below. Back in the parking area, note at the west side of the lot, a second path leads south to a picnic area, and a separate wedding site on the edge of the rim. Also flanked by two wildlife-proof, metal garbage containers, a gravel and dirt path leads to a small grove of trees with a number of picnic tables overlooking the canyon. From the grove, the path continues to the right to an open area surrounded by pinyon pine trees. Two rows of half-log wooden benches face a rock altar at the rim\u2019s edge. Note a permit is required to use the wedding site. North versus South Wayside Panel An aerial photograph of the canyon fills the face of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. Entitled \u201cNorth versus South,\u201d a yellow inset illustration at the top right shows the changing depth of the canyon in profile, with the Colorado River identified at its lowest point towards the left. Text reads: The slicing power of the Colorado River has given Grand Canyon its depth (1 mile, 1.6 km), while side stream erosion has given the canyon its width. Water is the single most powerful force acting on the canyon today. This is especially apparent on the North Rim, where the landscape is a maze of jutting side canyons, rock islands, and horseshoe-shaped alcoves. The North Rim has eroded more than 7 miles (11 km) from the river\u2019s edge, while the South Rim has only retreated 3 miles (5 km). Why? Because the North Rim is higher than the South Rim by 1,200 feet (366 m) and captures twice the amount of rain and snow. Since the plateaus are higher to the north, water from the North Rim runs south into the canyon, causing greater side canyon incisions. Water on the South Rim runs south too, away from the canyon, resulting in less erosion and a steeper profile. At the lower left, a black label with the words, \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d points to your location here at Cape Royal on the North Rim, directly opposite Grandview on the South Rim, with the Colorado River snaking between them in the center. Text at the lower right states: The North Rim receives up to 12 feet (4 m) of snow each winter, while the South Rim gets about 5 feet (1.5 m) of annual snowfall. Building Temples Wayside Panel A color photograph of two of the most stunning formations visible from Cape Royal fills the bottom of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail: the Vishnu Temple formation beside Wotan\u2019s Throne. Text at the top left of the panel reads: Building Temples At first glance the canyon resembles ancient temples towering above the river. Geologist Clarence Dutton named many of the canyon\u2019s formations temples, after Eastern religious and spiritual deities like Shiva and Vishnu. Cliffs, slopes, alcoves, plateaus, mesas, buttes, terraces, and platforms all make up what we call temples in Grand Canyon. Temples form when side canyon erosion produces peninsula-like projections off the main rims, like here on Cape Royal. Further erosion transforms the peninsulas into islands, like Wotan\u2019s Throne, and separates them from the rim, like Vishnu Temple. Erosion continues, as softer rock erodes and undercuts harder rock, until the temple is gone. At the top right, a series of three, inset illustrations show how temples are constructed. In the first illustration, a peninsula-like projection of rock juts out from the canyon rim due to side canyon erosion. The second illustration shows that peninsula beginning to detach from the rim. A caption reads, \u201cWith continued erosion, the peninsulas become islands, separated from the rims.\u201d In the third illustration, the \u2018island\u2019 becomes narrower and more distinct. A third caption reads, \u201cTemple erosion continues as softer rock, which erodes easier and faster, undercuts harder rock, leaving the hard rock without support and causing it to break and fall. The sequence continues until the temple has vanished.\u201d At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of a roughly square stone temple topped with crumbling, triangular rocks. Text reads: Ancient Temples Looking at this Vishnu Temple built 1,500 years ago in India, can you see why geologist Clarence Dutton thought fitting to name canyon formations temples? Can you find Grand Canyon\u2019s Vishnu Temple in the view? Which Vishnu Temple is older? Trapped in the Canyon Wayside Panel A crisp panoramic color photograph of the canyon fills the face of a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. Text at the top left reads: Trapped in the Canyon Grand Canyon National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior Your view from Cape Royal extends across the canyon and may reach 100 miles (160 km) on a clear day. Sometimes, however, the view within the canyon is hidden or murky. Why? When the winds are calm, cold air can drain into the canyon and become trapped. If moisture in the cold air is high enough, clouds may form in the canyon, with only the rims and highest temples poking through. Less appealing are the times when the cold air carries air pollution into the canyon from nearby industries or forest fires. Fire managers try to avoid such smoke impacts, but sometimes it happens. Human industry tries to lessen their impacts too. One nearby coal-fired power plant invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce its contribution to these haze layers that get trapped in the canyon. A caption above the canyon photograph reads: \u201cTrends show the best visibility days at Grand Canyon are getting clearer, while the haziest days remain the same.\u201d At the top right, an inset color photograph shows a white cloud hanging over the canyon. A caption reads: \u201cCold air can trap forest fire smoke in the canyon, masking the view.\u201d",

The wash layout changes throughout the year due to flash floods, rockfalls, and weather. It is easy to cliff out, overheat, or get stuck in mud. Bring good shoes, water, and and any other hiking essentials you need. Securing ropes for technical climbing is not permitted. DO NOT enter this wash if rain is forecasted. Flash floods can be deadly.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead:</strong> Follow the Lees Ferry access road 1.3 miles (2.1 km). The trailhead is at the pull out on your left.

Just across the road, the trail heads down along a wash down into a forested ravine.<br /> <br /> After passing an archaeological site, the trail descends further and cuts over to the right side of the wash. From here you wander underneath rocky outcrops until you reach a chest-high boulder resting under one of these large overhangs. The spring is on the cliff side of the boulder. The trail ends at the spring, .4 mile from the trailhead.<br /> <br /> Do NOT drink the water.</p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance</strong>:\u00a01.0 miles (1.6 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change</strong>:\u00a0~ 300 feet (~91 m)<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time</strong>:\u00a01-2 hours</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your hike and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia\u00a0</strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

There are guardrails around the cliff edge for your safety.<br /> <br /> Directly below is the Colorado River's \"Big Bend\", where it dramatically shifts its previously southward course by executing a sharp 90-degree turn to the west, cutting directly into a major uplift on the Colorado Plateau known as the Kaibab Upwarp. Looking to the west, one can glimpse in the distance where the river plunges into the black, narrow, confined depths of the Granite Gorge.The airline distance to the opposite rim of the canyon is 18 miles; to the Colorado River, 4 miles. The river is about 300 feet wide as seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> To the east, several thousand feet below where you are now standing, is the broad expanse of a plateau known as the Marble Platform, which is part of the Navajo Nation. The brilliant colors of the Painted Desert can be glimpsed in the distance.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Also to the\u00a0east,\u00a0and situated back from the Canyon rim,\u00a0is a prominent flat-topped mesa\u00a0called Cedar Mountain. Just beyond this mountain the Little Colorado River gorge extends north and south as a crack in the surface of the earth. Tracing the gorge to the left, one may see where it connects with Grand Canyon. The point of connection is where Grand Canyon begins. From that point the Canyon extends 217 miles westward as measured by the Colorado River. Fifty miles of the canyon may be seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> Dark cliffs bordering the Colorado River below Desert View are composed of lavas resulting from volcanic activity long before the cutting of Grand Canyon began. For the most part the walls of Grand Canyon consist of material which hardened into rock after being deposited by wind or water: Consequently, this lava rock is very different in origin and character from the rest of the rocks of the Canyon walls.</p> <h3>1956 Aviation Accident Memorial</h3> <p>At Desert View point, a National Historic Landmark plaque and stone memorial commemorate the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site,<strong> </strong>a horrific airline collision over\u00a0Grand Canyon that took place on June 30, 1956.\u00a0<br /> <br /> On that day,\u00a0a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon, and\u00a0killing all 128 people onboard the two flights.

On June 30, 1956, a United Airlines DC-7 and TWA Super Constellation maneuvered around towering cumulus clouds on a partly clear day. All 128 passengers and crew perished when the planes collided at an altitude of 21,000 feet (6,400 m) above Temple and Chuar buttes. Passengers included prominent businesspeople and families.

Recovery personnel removed the remains of the 70 accident victims from the TWA flight, and all but three were interred in a mass grave at Flagstaff Citizens Cemetery (R). Twenty-nine identified passengers were returned home for burial. Two smaller photographs show a corroded key and a rusty lighter, reminders of that day.\"",

The realization of preserving trails and historic buildings, delivering educational programs for the public, conducting scientific research, and protecting wildlife and their natural habitat has been cultivated, in part, through GCC's memberships, publications, educational outreach, park stores, philanthropic efforts, and a field institute featuring guided natural and cultural history programs.<br /> <br /> Your purchases at each GCC Park Store will support these and many other initiatives in Grand Canyon. A GCC membership provides you with a 15% discount on all purchases at any of GCC bookstores in the park. In addition, your membership may allow for separate discounts at other park\u00a0cooperating associations and stores on separate federal public lands.</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Conservancy (GCC) Stores</h3> <p><strong>GCC operates multiple Park Stores in the park:</strong><br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center<br /> Kolb Studio<br /> Tusayan Museum and Ruin<br /> Desert View Watchtower<br /> North Rim Visitor Center</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Field Institute</h3> <p>The Grand Canyon Conservancy Field Institute helps visitors experience Grand Canyon like never before. Through classes, guided hiking trips, and educational tours you will learn about the geology and cultural and natural history of this magnificent place from those who know it best-geologists, historians, ecologists, archaeologists, and other experts.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>In 1932, park ranger naturalist Edwin \"Eddie\" McKee founded the Grand Canyon Natural History Association. As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its\u00a0beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 20, Grand Canyon Lodge Circle. 7 minutes. About 400 feet (120 meters) south of the Visitor Center, Route 67 reaches its southernmost end in a loop road that runs in front of a U-shaped, multiple log and stone building complex. Note a \u2018Do Not Enter\u2019 sign at the head of the loop road, as access is restricted to authorized commercial service providers, and folks entering to use the accessible parking spaces along the east near Rough Rider Saloon. Here we find Deli in the Pines to the west, Grand Canyon Lodge to the south, and Rough Rider Saloon, the Post Office, and the gift shop along the east. A stone sidewalk porch at ground level runs in front of Deli in the Pines and Grand Canyon Lodge. Note also a raised stone sidewalk porch in front the gift shop, Post Office, and Rough Rider Saloon. This porch can be accessed from a set of stone stairs at the north and south ends of the porch, or via an access ramp that begins just north of the gift shop at ground level. From here, the ramp leads about 60 feet (18 meters) east up a slight incline, then turns right to continue 100 feet (30 meters) south along the back of the building. Turning right again, the ramp continues up a slight incline with metal handrails at the left and center, then through a covered, stone hallway to arrive at the south end of the raised sidewalk porch, with Rough Rider Saloon at the right. The loop road surrounds an oval landscaped area in its center. Towards the southern end of the oval, a metal flagpole stands before a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. A rough, stone sidewalk spans the 40 foot (12 meter) width of the oval in front of the wayside. Should you move to the wayside, be mindful of any vehicular traffic when crossing the loop road. Entitled, \u201cGrand Canyon Lodge,\u201d the panel tells of the need for and construction of the lodge. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. A wide, covered, flat stone sidewalk porch runs around the front of all the buildings, supported by large stone columns and wide wooden posts, spaced about every eight to ten feet (two-and-a-half to three meters) along the roofline at the edge of the sidewalk. Beginning at the far, northwest side of the complex, a set of restrooms is located up a couple wide, stone steps from the loop road, through a single wooden door. The men\u2019s restroom is to the left; the women\u2019s restroom is to the right. From the restrooms, move about 50 feet (15 meters) south along the porch to the two side-by-side glass and metal doors of Deli in the Pines at the right. Coffee drinks are available daily, in addition to grab-and-go sandwiches, pizza, soup or chili, and snacks. Grab-and-go food menu items and beverages are available daily. Note there may be a two-tier wooden bench outside the deli doors at the edge of the sidewalk. From Deli in the Pines, continue south along the porch another 40 feet (12 meters), then turn left about 50 feet (15 meters) to the main entrance to Grand Canyon Lodge at the right. To the right of the doors, note a water fountain with a bottle filling spigot mounted on the outside wall of the lodge. Also note a wildlife-proof, metal garbage on the other side of the porch, immediately opposite the water fountain. The lodge features private cabins, both along and near the rim of Grand Canyon in the forest. Interior wheelchair lifts allow access to the auditorium and dining room. The dining room serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. Note reservations are required for dinner. At the back of the lodge, two large, stone patios with wooden deck chairs afford unobstructed views of the canyon. A third interior wheelchair lift allows access to the patio level. Note also several narrow, uneven stone staircases and paths that lead down from the patio to the Bright Angel Point Trail along the base of the lodge. From the front doors of the lodge, the porch continues about 50 feet (15 meters) east past a long line of large, rough-hewn, wooden deck chairs placed along the outside stone wall at the right. A 15-foot (three meter) wide stone staircase, with a metal handrail at each side and another in the middle, leads up nine steps to the stone porch area in front of Rough Rider Saloon. Whether you arrive at this location via the stairs or the access ramp, here at the southern end of the stone porch, white, arched lettering across the top of a six-foot (two meter) square plate glass window spells, \u201cSaloon.\u201d Guests are invited to stop in for a quick cappuccino, espresso, or coffee in the morning. Baked goods and breakfast burritos are also available from 5:30 to 10:30 am. In the afternoon, from 11 am to 11 pm, cold beverages and pizza slices are available while the saloon transitions to evening dinner options and a bar. About six feet (two meters) north along the porch from the saloon is the Post Office. Vertical metal bars cover the face of a double-hung window in the log wall, with a small open slot at the bottom center. At the top left side of the window, white letters carved into the first of two, small wooden signs sticking out from the building read, \u201cPost Office.\u201d The second reads, \u201cN Rim A Z, 8 6 0 5 2.\u201d Beneath the window, a word above a horizontal slot at the top of a plain, painted, brown wooden panel reads, \u201cLetters.\u201d About six feet (two meters) to the left (north) of the window, note a sturdy, three foot (one meter) tall wooden writing desk juts out from the wall about two feet (60 centimeters). A second, narrow wooden shelf is mounted to the wall slightly above it. Note also a garbage can on the porch, placed just to the left of the desk. The Post Office is an active operation that handles post cards and letters for residents and visitors to Grand Canyon's North Rim. It is open Monday through Friday during the season between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm, and from 1 pm to 5 pm At the far northern end of the raised, stone porch is the door to the gift shop. The shop offers visitors to the North Rim gifts, postcards, and souvenirs of their trip, from clothing and accessories to Native Americans handicrafts. Sub-Script Grand Canyon Lodge Wayside Panel A sepia-tone photograph fills the left side of the panel. In front a line of buses arrayed in front of Grand Canyon Lodge, a line of men and women stand a couple rows deep, all dressed in light-colored, one-piece dresses or white shirts with dark pants. Two of the men hold a banjo and guitar. A caption reads: Lodge employees, in 1930, \u201csing away\u201d departing guests in front of the first Grand Canyon Lodge. Entitled, \u201cGrand Canyon Lodge,\u201d text at the top of the panel reads: When Grand Canyon became a national park in 1919, the North Rim was scarcely developed. While the South Rim had grand hotels and many visitor programs and services, the hard-to-reach North Rim had only rustic tent cabins for 40 guests. The National Park Service\u2019s first Director, Stephen T. Mather, urged the Union Pacific Railroad to improve access to the North Rim and build a rustic lodge with cabins. During 1927\u20131928, architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed and built a lodge using local Kaibab Limestone and ponderosa pine logs taken from the site. Just four years after completion, the new lodge and four cabins burned to the ground. At the top right, a caption above a color inset drawing of the lodge reads: Architect Underwood\u2019s rendering of the original lodge shows its second story level and a three-story observation tower, both eliminated in the lodge\u2019s reconstruction in 1937. A quote above the rendering reads: So cunningly have the architects planned this remarkable building that it seems to have sprung full-grown from the canyon wall itself. \u2014Union Pacific Railroad, 1929 At the bottom right, a black-and-white picture shows a roofless, burned-out lodge, with blackened stone walls. A caption reads: On September 1, 1932, fire left only the foundations and walls of the first lodge. The present-day lodge, rebuilt on the old foundation, features more stone and less timber to make it more fire resistant. The steeper roof sheds snow more efficiently.",

      "audioDescription": "Moving east along the Trail of Time from the Village, a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel sits to the left of a roughly one-foot square chunk of black and gray striated igneous rock mounted on a 15-inch (38 cm) square concrete pedestal on the ground. Text at the top of the panel reads: \"Grand Canyon's rocks are incredibly old. Grand Canyon's oldest known rock is called the Elves Chasm Gneiss (pronounced \"NICE\") and it is 1,840 million years old.\" On the left of the panel, a caption under a color photograph looking out towards Maricopa Point from your present location reads: \"Imagine how old? The 1,840 million-year-old Elves Chasm Gneiss is almost unimaginably old, yet it is only two-fifths the age of the Earth. To reach the 4,560 million-year age of the Earth along the Trail of Time, walk west 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles), to Maricopa Point.\" A graphic in the center of the panel shows a central cluster of blue and red circles being orbited by five black circles along separate elliptical lines. A caption reads: \"How do we know? Geologists can tell how old a rock is by counting the atoms produced by natural radioactive decay.\" Referring to the rock sample at your right, text on the right side of the panel continues: \"Touch a rock that is 1,840 million years old. This rock sample came from the bottom of the canyon 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of here.\" Next to a color photograph showing a layer of similar rock beside the Colorado riverbed, a caption reads: \"This rock was first formed as granite when magma cooled 1,840 million years ago. Pressure and heat then changed it into gneiss (pronounced NICE) about 1,700 million years ago.\" A map of the Trail of Time runs along the bottom of the panel. Text below the map reads: \"You are on a timeline. 1 long step = 1 million years.\" A graphic of the V-shaped Trail of Time portal rock column at the bottom right asks, \"Where in the rock record?\" An arrow points just above the bottom of the column with the label, \"1,840 million years ago.\"",

After following this path for 0.4 miles (0.6 km), turn right and follow the Rim Trail east for nearly 0.5 miles (0.8 km). The view is worth the walk!</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Grandeur Point offers an especially dramatic view of Bright Angel Canyon, which slices directly across Grand Canyon and cuts deep into both the South and North Rims. Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and\u00a0small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear\u00a0cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago. Since its initial formation, the Bright Angel Fault has been reactivated several times, sometimes as a normal fault (such as it is now) and sometimes as a reverse and/or strike-slip fault.<br /> \u00a0</p>",

      "audioDescription": "A two-foot (60 cm) tall limestone wall lines the north side of an asphalt sidewalk next to the loop road. A five-foot (1.5 m) wide opening in the wall leads from the road about 100 feet (30 m) down a paved, gently sloping sidewalk to the overlook. Note that opposite this opening, a crosswalk across the road leads to a set of vault toilets in a wooded area of oak, ponderosa and pinyon pine in the middle of the loop.<br />Just before the overlook, there is a 20-foot wide by 10-foot (3 m) deep oval garden area ringed with low limestone rocks. Continue around the garden on either side to a three-foot (1 m) tall curved limestone wall, 40-feet (12 m) across.<br />At the eastern end of the overlook, a vintage panoramic photograph of Horseshoe Mesa fills a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top reads:<br />\"Last Chance Mine<br />If a horseshoe can bring luck, why not a horseshoe-shaped mesa? Some 2,500 feet (760 m) below you sits Horseshoe Mesa. There, in 1890, Pete Berry and fellow miners discovered copper and began digging the Last Chance Mine. The ore was rich (15 to 30 percent pure copper), but like all Grand Canyon mines, the amount of ore was small. Berry created other opportunities to make money. In 1897, he built the Grandview Hotel near here, and adventuresome tourists mingled with the miners on Horseshoe Mesa. But, when the railroad came to the Grand Canyon in 1901, its depot was 14 miles away from Berry's hotel. In 1907, copper prices crashed. Luck had changed for Pete and his wife Martha, so in 1919 they left, moving to their son's ranch outside the park.\"<br />A black-and-white photograph at the left center shows men and mules on a steep switchback trail buttressed with logs and rocks. A caption reads:<br />\"Berry and his crew built a 3-mile (5 km) long trail to the mine, which was one of the finest constructed trails in Grand Canyon during the pioneer period. Today it is a rough, steep route for well-prepared hikers.\"<br />In the center, a second photograph shows about 10 miners standing in front of a dining hall and bunkhouse on the mesa, while a third photograph at the right shows heavily-laden mules on a steep, rocky trail. A caption reads:<br />\"Mules and burros carried 200-pound (90 kg) loads of copper ore up the trail. From Grandview Point the ore had to be shipped to El Paso, Texas, a serious limit on mining profits.<br />The Last Chance Mine operation on Horseshoe Mesa, early 1900.\"",

The well-built trail eventually provided access to more tourists than miners, as Grandview Point provided one of the best access routes into the canyon at that time. Relatively undamaged segments of the original miner trail remain in the upper portion of Grandview Trail, testifying to the engineering prowess of the builders as they devised creative solutions to the problems that the landscape presented.<br /> <br /> The trail descends to the right of the established Grandview Point overlook. The Kaibab/Toroweap section traverses steep slopes, and the old trail is eroded in places, so careful attention\u00a0is critical. Vertical steps were placed by constructing log \"cribs\" that were chained or pinned to the cliff face to provide a foundation for the trail where nature provided none. The exposure along these sections impresses some hikers to the point of being considered hazardous. Unfortunately, several of the historic cribs were swept away by landslides during the winter of 2005. Trail crews restored the trail, but not the historical context of the old logs. A series of sloping ledges at the top of the Coconino Sandstone cliff demands caution, especially when icy or wet. Be careful throughout the Kaibab and Toroweap sections - a fall here could have catastrophic consequences.<br /> <br /> The original cobblestone \"riprap\" trail construction remains throughout most of the Coconino section. Large slabs of sandstone placed edgewise provided a durable and\u00a0labor intensive\u00a0walking surface. The trail comes to the top of a dramatic east-facing gully at the contact between the Coconino Sandstone and Hermit Shale (known locally as Coconino Saddle), which offers tantalizing views into the upper valley of Hance Creek. Steep cobblestone switchbacks below Coconino Saddle descend through the Hermit Shale to the Supai Formation, where the steepness of the trail lessens as it begins a more gradual traverse out into the canyon and down to Horseshoe Mesa.<br /> <br /> Along the trail, you might notice what appears to be trash or remnants of past mining operations, including rusty cans, nails, tools and structures. These objects are actually protected as archaeological resources. <strong>Please leave these objects as you found them, where you found them</strong>.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only.\u00a0</strong>There are no maintained water sources along Grandview Trail. Seasonal springs below Horseshoe Mesa may offer water (which must be treated or filtered), but are not reliable.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Saddle</strong><br /> <em>Recommended summer day hike</em>; <em>no signs present</em><br /> 2.2 miles (3.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,000 feet (305 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Horseshoe Mesa</strong><br /> <em>Please be respectful of campers</em><br /> 6.0 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Viewpoint</strong><br /> <em>This point is on the very northern edge of the western arm of Horseshoe Mesa.</em><br /> 7.6 miles (12.2 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Page Spring</strong><br /> <em><strong>Water contains high arsenic levels</strong></em><br /> 7.4 miles (11.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,040 feet (925 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>ANY</strong>\u00a0camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> Backpackers camping on Horseshoe Mesa (BF5) must camp in designated sites. Three (3) small group sites are located east of the standing masonry structure. The large group site is further north and east of the little butte that caps Horseshoe Mesa. Vault toilet facilities are located at both areas. <strong>Camping is not allowed in or near historic mines and structures</strong>. Camping in the Cottonwood (BG9) and Hance Creek (BE9) use areas is \"at-large\". All hikers should bring animal-proof food containers; mice and ravens are skilled at opening and looting packs or bags in this area.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p>Every year, this trail bears witness to accidents resulting in serious injury or death.\u00a0<strong>Grandview Trail is steep, rarely maintained, and does not provide access to the Colorado River.</strong>\u00a0It is not a recommended first hike into the canyon.<br /> <br /> Old decomposing mines are inherently unsafe. For your safety and the protection of local bat populations, all historic mines are closed to visitation. You may see artifacts scattered about-these are protected by federal antiquities laws.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Cave of the Domes is closed to protect roosting bats and other sensitive cave resources.</strong>\u00a0Bats are particularly sensitive to human disturbance and will abandon roost sites.\u00a0Permits are required to enter caves in Grand Canyon National Park due to the extremely sensitive nature of the cultural and natural resources inside. Contact the Backcountry Information Center for information.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia,\u00a0</strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Cape Royal and Grandview Point Quads (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>Louis D. Boucher, the \"hermit\" of Hermit Creek basin, lived in this area for 20 years. Boucher built the Boucher Trail (west of the Hermit Trail)\u00a0and seasonal residences at Dripping Springs and near Boucher Creek. Though socially active in the South Rim community, residents labeled Boucher a hermit because he lived alone.<br /> <br /> The modern trailhead is located just west of Hermits Rest. Follow\u00a0the dirt road from the restrooms to make your way to the trailhead. <strong>There is no parking for day hikers at this trailhead when the Hermit (Red) Route shuttle is active; day hikers must ride the free shuttle bus to reach the trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> <b>For experienced desert hikers only.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Water from\u00a0springs must be purified.</b><br /> <br /> Allow extra hiking time; <b>conditions are more difficult than on the Bright Angel and South Kaibab Trails</b>.</p> <h3>Trail Desciption</h3> \u00a0 <p>The upper section of the Hermit Trail is quite steep, dropping almost 2,000 vertical feet (610 m) in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). Passage through the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone is via well-defined switchbacks. Most of the Hermit Trail was originally surfaced with large hand-fitted rock slabs that created a smooth walking surface. Ongoing erosion has claimed much of this remarkably labor-intensive paving, but a few isolated fragments survive, especially in the Coconino Sandstone. Fossilized animal tracks have been noted in many locations throughout the canyon, but they were first studied in detail along the Hermit Trail. Observant hikers can see a few of these fossilized lizard-like tracks in the lower half of the Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> The trail enters Waldron Basin, a quiet, isolated pocket within the Hermit side canyon, at 1.2 miles (1.9 km). The Waldron Trail junction is encountered soon after at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), followed by the Dripping Springs Trail junction at 1.75 miles (2.8 km). To continue on the Hermit Trail, stay right at both junctions.\u00a0Dripping Springs, however, does make an excellent day hike destination. After the Dripping Springs trail junction, the Hermit Trail drops down along the east side of Hermit Creek gorge. Santa Maria Spring is reached at 2.5 miles (4 km) along the trail, offering a trickle of water and a historic masonry rest house which provides welcome shade during the summer.<br /> <br /> Continuing on the Hermit Trail past this point is generally not recommended for a day hike during the summer. During cooler months, Lookout Point, an additional 1.5 miles (2.4 km) down the trail from Santa Maria Spring, is also a reasonable single-day option for those seeking a longer hike. Between Santa Maria Spring and the top of the Redwall Limestone at Cathedral Stairs, the Hermit Trail is characterized by long traverses through the Supai Formation. This section of the trail is tucked up against the west facing walls of the south rim and offers hikers a period of extended shade during the hotter months.<br /> <br /> At Cathedral Stairs, the descent becomes unrelenting. An endless series of rocky switchbacks eventually leads hikers through the Redwall cliff and down the west-facing talus below Cope Butte to the intersection with the Tonto Trail. The Tonto Trail is an important Inner Canyon route that allows access in both directions along the Tonto Platform, east to Monument Creek, west to Hermit Creek. Turn left (west) and follow the Tonto Trail about a mile to the Hermit Creek campsite. Be sure to walk downstream a short distance during your stay at Hermit Creek, or even descend all the way to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapid.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Waldron Basin</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,240 feet (378 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring Trail Junction</strong><br /> 3.6 miles (5.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3-4 hours / 1370 feet (418 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Maria Spring</strong><br /> 5 miles (8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 1,680 feet (512 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring</strong>\u00a0(via the Dripping Spring Trail)<br /> 7 miles (11.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 5-7 hours / 1040 feet (317 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Breezy Point</strong><br /> 11 miles (17.7 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,220 feet (677 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Tonto Trail Junction</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Tonto Trail Junction and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 14 miles (22.5 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,430 feet (1,045 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hermit Creek</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Hermit Creek and back in a day.\u00a0</em><em>Water requires purification.</em></strong><br /> 16.4 miles (26.4 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,740 feet (1,140 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Colorado River / Hermit Rapids</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to the Colorado River and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 19.4 miles (31.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4.340 feet (1,323 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>A spring-fed water station is available near the vault toilets along the gravel road that leads to the Hermit Trail parking area. Santa Maria Spring, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) down the trail, offers year-round spring water. Dripping Springs, 7 miles (11.3 km) down the trail (via the Dripping Springs side trail), also offers year-round spring water. Hermit Creek is a perennial water source for those descending down the trail for a stay at the backcountry campsites there. Water from any natural sources in Grand Canyon, including springs, creeks, and the Colorado River, must be purified before drinking.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>From March 1st to November 30th, access to the Hermit Road is restricted to shuttle buses only. However, backpackers with a valid backcountry permit for the Hermit or Boucher Trails are allowed access by personal vehicle\u00a0during this time. To gain access to the Hermit Road, please enter the numerical code provided by the Backcountry Information Center. Drive eight\u00a0miles (12.9 km) west along Hermit Road to Hermits Rest then continue on the dirt road 0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> From December 1st through the end of February, the Hermit Road is open to all traffic. The park shuttle buses do not operate along the Hermit Road during this time.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>any</strong>\u00a0camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> The only legal places to camp in the Hermit Creek drainage are the designated campsites at Hermit Creek (BM7, toilet on site) and Hermit Rapids (BM8, no toilet). A sign with a prominent \"L\" marks the large group site near the toilet at BM7. Large groups of 7-11 people must use this site.

The Hermit Creek basin was the scene of one of the most aggressive of these improvement efforts. Initiated by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911, this program involved development of the rim and also included the construction of what was,\u00a0at the time, a state-of-the-art rim-to-river trail.<br /> <br /> The Hermit Trail was built to serve a luxury campsite near Hermit Creek. Hermit Camp predated Phantom Ranch by 10 years\u00a0and in its heyday was complete with a tramway from the rim, a functional automobile for transportation within the facility, and a Fred Harvey Company chef. Operations ceased in 1930, but for two decades Hermit Camp was the last word in gracious tourism below the rim. As is always the case at Grand Canyon, time and erosion have taken a heavy toll. The old Hermit Trail is today a mere shadow of its former self, but for experienced and knowledgeable canyon backpackers, the walk offers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A rock and pebble-strewn path leads a quarter-mile (400 m) from Hermits Rest west along the rim of Grand Canyon to the Hermit Trail Trailhead.

      "bodyText": "<h4>Hours of Operation</h4> <p><strong>Gift Shop and Snack Bar: 9 am to 5 pm</strong></p> <p>Hermits Rest is an iconic and historic stop, at the conclusion of Hermit Road, and the Canyon Rim Trail. It also serves as the gateway to magnificent backcountry hiking trails that originate from the Hermit Trail, a steeply winding path into the canyon that begins 0.25 miles (0.4 km) west of this distinctive building.<br /> <br /> Hermits Rest was built to resemble an old miner's cabin with native stonework, a giant alcove fireplace, and front porch. It presently offers a gift shop, snack bar, and west end views of Grand Canyon. Restrooms and a water bottle filling station are available outside, behind the main building.</p> <h4>History</h4> <p>Commissioned by the Fred Harvey Company in 1914, Hermits Rest is\u00a0one several structures designed by architect Mary\u00a0Colter. Built\u00a0as a rest area at the end of scenic Hermit Road\u00a0(also constructed by\u00a0Fred Harvey),\u00a0Hermits Rest was also the last bastion of civilization for those visitors preparing to descend down into Grand Canyon on\u00a0Hermit Trail.<br /> <br /> Horse-drawn carriages, and later automobiles, operated by Fred Harvey,\u00a0carried visitors on scenic tours along the Hermit Road, dropping them off here for a respite before the return trip to Grand Canyon Village. The distinctive style of this structure is unique and skillfully crafted out of native materials that blend in with the natural environment.<br /> <br /> Today, this location is frequented by hikers, travelers, and history enthusiasts that arrive by foot, bicycle, the Hermit Road (Red) Route shuttle bus, and, during the months of December through February, personal vehicles.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Move through a set of central wood and glass double doors onto the flagstone floor of a roughly 25-foot (8 m) wide by 20-foot (6 m) long Great Room inside Hermits Rest. The roof above soars nearly two stories high, topped with a flat, wooden beam ceiling. Two massive 18-inch (46 cm) round vertical wooden support pillars stand at the left and right about eight feet (2.4 m) in front of the doors, ringed with black metal candelabra. Large windows in the front of the room let in streams of natural light. Note several free-standing tables and display cabinets filled with books and gifts placed along the front windows and about the room. There is a four-foot (1.2 m) tall glass-enclosed display counter about six feet (2 m) to the right of the right-hand pillar filled with jewelry and other items for sale. Twenty feet (6 m) in front of the doors, the entire south wall opens into an enormous alcove, 15 feet (4.5 m) tall by 15 feet (4.5 m) wide by 10 feet (3 m) deep. The flagstone floor continues into the alcove up a small step from the rest of the room. A six-foot (2 m) tall arched stone fireplace sits at the back of the alcove, decorated with several antique kitchen and fireplace tools which you may touch. Note there is a low, six-foot (2 m) wide wooden bench directly in front of the fireplace, flanked by two wooden chairs with lattice-strap seat pans and carved wooden backs. A large stack of wood sits to the left of the fireplace behind a small wooden side table. Two additional black metal candelabra are affixed five-feet (1.5 m) high on the alcove walls to the left and right of the fireplace. To the east of the Great Room, two smaller seven-foot (2.1 m) tall stone arches lead into a curio shop with a smaller stone fireplace. Other souvenirs, artwork, and clothing items are available here. Outside, a limestone porch overlooks the canyon to the north underneath a wooden roof. Move up a couple stairs at the western end of the building to a small patio area with a snack bar. Fifteen feet (4.5 m) further west, two more stone steps lead up to a 10-foot (3 m) wide rocky trail leading to the Hermit Trailhead. Standing just a few feet (about 2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, Hermits Rest is a stone building tucked into a small man-made earthen mound, built around and atop the building to blend it in with its setting. Using the natural timber and boulders of the area, the exposed portions of the structure look like a natural rock formation. Two stone chimneys appear as outgrowths of the building. The main chimney appears as a stone outcropping rising from the ground on the south side of the building. It is generally cylindrical in shape and the stones are stained by soot. About three feet (1 m) above the ground, a course of stones projects out from the chimney. Above them, rectangular stones are oriented vertically and the gaps between them provide openings for the exhaust. The holes facing the south side have been blocked by additional stones. The stones in this course are rounder in shape. Thin, rectangular stones are situated above the openings and span the diameter of the chimney. A secondary chimney extends up from the east elevation wall. It is fully integrated with the stone wall below and gently narrows as it rises. It is generally cylindrical in shape and the individual stones decrease in size as it rises. Rectangular stones, oriented vertically, cap the top. Hermits Rest blends easily with its environment. Each stone is irregular in shape and varies greatly in size from each other. Generally, the lower stones are larger and rectangular. The stones above are more irregular in shape and smaller in size. A large stone lintel is present above the east elevation window opening. A small porch supported by peeled log posts stands to one side of the outside observation area, overlooking the canyon rim.",

      "passportStampLocationDescription": "Hermits Rest has a unique, dated passport cancellation stamp which reads \"Hermit's Rest\" and \"Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - Est. 1919\". However, since Hermits Rest is managed by Xanerra (one of the park's concessionaires), rather than the National Park Service or the Grand Canyon Conservancy, it is not considered an official passport stamp location. That is why the format of this stamp is different from the others, and why it is in blue ink rather than the official green ink of the Intermountain Region.",

His father was a manager at Phantom Ranch, and Ken had the luxury of growing up a world wonder and exploring as much of it as possible.<br /> <br /> In his twenties, he began a career that started in Grand Canyon, followed by the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, and Point Reyes National Seashore.<br /> <br /> On the morning of August 5, 1973, Ken approached three individuals while on duty at Point Reyes. One of them fired shots at the park ranger, who was found dead at the scene by a colleague later that day. His gun was holstered and concealed under his uniform jacket. The individuals, apparently members of The Black Panther organization, were later apprehended and convicted on evidence of deer poaching, stolen checks, drug possession, and the murder of Ken Patrick.<br /> <br /> Ken Patrick was laid to rest at the South Rim in Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery on August 9, 1973.</p>",

His father was a manager at Phantom Ranch, and Ken had the luxury of growing up a world wonder and exploring as much of it as possible.<br /> <br /> In his twenties, he began a career that started in Grand Canyon, followed by the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, and Point Reyes National Seashore.<br /> <br /> On the morning of August 5, 1973, Ken approached three individuals while on duty at Point Reyes. One of them fired shots at the park ranger, who was found dead at the scene by a colleague later that day. His gun was holstered and concealed under his uniform jacket. The individuals, apparently members of The Black Panther organization, were later apprehended and convicted on evidence of deer poaching, stolen checks, drug possession, and the murder of Ken Patrick.<br /> <br /> Ken Patrick was laid to rest at the South Rim in Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery on August 9, 1973.</p>",

These unique rocks are exposed in just a few places within the canyon, and are visible at only a few viewpoints. Hidden among the titled layers and cradled by the river is Unkar Delta, where ancient Puebloan people once cultivated beans, corn, and squash.<br /> <br /> Listen for the roar of Hance Rapid, almost four miles (6.4 km) away, and for the cries of hawks and other raptors along this important migration route. Forests on this side of the canyon and on the North Rim, just eight miles (13 km) away, make Lipan Point an ideal spot for birds crossing the canyon.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h4> <p>The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> In this part of the canyon, instead of being confined by the hard Vishnu basement rocks within the narrow Inner Gorge to the west, the Colorado River instead winds its way through layers of soft, purple sandstone belonging to the Dox Formation. This is why Lipan Point features such spectacular views of the river. Above these purple layers is the black Cardenas Basalt, formed by lava flows erupting due to continental collisions during the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia over one billion years ago. To the west, one can see another stretch of river cutting down through layers of purple, orange, and brown rocks; these are the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, and Shinumo Sandstone, respectively. One can also see where the river crosses from these layers into the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks underneath to begin forming the Inner Gorge.</p>",

A large gate and clearing on the rim are all that remain of the Orphan Mine and its brief hotel operations. Looking west and down into the immediate left of the viewpoint reveals derelict mining equipment, cable line and supports, and a large man-made hole in the side of the canyon.</p> <h4>History</h4> <p>Maricopa Point is named for the Maricopa Indians who lived in south-central Arizona. They lived with the Pima Indians and were noted for their friendly approach to white pioneers. As you walk out onto this stunning vista, exhibit panels reveal the controversial mining history in the canyon from a spectacular viewpoint.<br /> <br /> The nearby Orphan Lode Mine started as a copper mine in 1891 and then produced rich uranium ore until 1967. Be sure to stay on the trail, as \"hot spots\" from mined uranium ores still remain!<br /> <br /> The National Park Service is restoring this mine site.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "East from the shuttle bus stop here at Maricopa Point, a six-foot (2 m) wide asphalt-paved trail lined with low, six- to twelve-inch (15 to 30 cm) high irregular stones leads north away from the road down a 200-foot (60 m) long path to the overlook area. As you approach the point, a four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing beginning at the left continues around the point along the edge of the canyon. The edge of Grand Canyon juts out here in a narrow promontory, extending northeast for about 100 feet (30 m) before dropping away vertically. The view from Maricopa encompasses over 180 degrees of Grand Canyon, with no significant obstructions between here and the river. Several miles of the Tonto Trail are visible below. Just west of Maricopa Point are the remains of Orphan Mine. Hold onto the railing and peer over the edge of the cliff to view an old circular mineshaft opening in the side of the cliff several hundred feet below. Some derelict metal mining equipment still remains above it.",

The Fred Harvey Company and the Santa Fe Railroad constructed the original \"Motor Lodge\" here in 1927. Traveling by automobile to the parks was quickly becoming fashionable. Rather than having to travel by train or carriage, people could journey in their own automobiles.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s, 36 cabins were added and 22 cabins were moved from Bright Angel Lodge. Many of the 120 cabins were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by more contemporary two-story hotel rooms in 1968. The only architectural component remaining from historic lodge buildings are the original stone pillars.</p>",

A wealthy\u00a0businessman from Chicago, Mather was avid conservationist and supporter of public lands,\u00a0who moved to Washington D.C. in 1915 to help found the National Park Service.\u00a0Appointed its first director\u00a0in 1917 he continued to promote park access, development, and use until he left office in 1929.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Mather believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives. During his tenure the Park Service grew to include sites such as Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains,\u00a0Mammoth Cave National Parks, and many others.<br /> <br /> He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good that he has done.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located about 1800 feet (550 m) northeast from the visitor center along a wide, smooth concrete path is Mather Point. The viewing area here is quite extensive with two major overlooks, each lined with four-foot (1.2 m) high metal safety railings built into the rocks that project out into the canyon. A plaque honoring Stephen Mather sits at the top right of a 20-foot (6 m) wide set of concrete stairs that lead down to the main overlook area. Note there is also a ramp down to the overlook located about 140 feet (42 m) west of the stairs. Following along the right handrail, move down 6 steps to a concrete landing. Continue eight feet (2.4 m) forward, moving to the right of a central limestone boulder in the center of the path to your left. Move eight steps down to a second landing, and continue 15 feet (4.5 m) forward to a central staircase. Move down 10 more steps to a third landing, and continue 20 feet (6 m) along the right-hand railing to a final set of steps. Move down seven steps to the landing at the point itself past a low, rocky platform to your left. Move all around the point, following along the railing. The powerful Colorado River snakes far below at the bottom of a one mile (1600 m) deep abyss. Colorful rock layers fill the cliffs all around you, including the tan Kaibab Formation, white and creamy Coconino Sandstone, red to orange Hermit Shale and Supai Formation, and dark gray to black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom. The panorama at Mather Point spans from Bright Angel Trail in the west to the South Kaibab Trail in the east. In between is the deep canyon of Pipe Creek, Cedar Ridge, and O'Neill Butte. The Tonto Trail is also visible. The North Rim stands 10 miles (16 km) away across the chasm. Back up on the rim, the railing continues in both directions from the point offering various other viewpoints. To the west, the Rim Trail offers more vistas all the way to Yavapai Point.",

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>,\u00a0a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "At the base of a towering cliff, and just above and alongside the trail, several steps lead up to a rustic stone resthouse. The building is about 20 feet long and 10 feet wide and all four sides are open to the air. The roof is supported by stone masonry pillars in each corner. Inside, and shaded from the sun, are several stone benches. Just below the building, and slightly down trail, a water bottle filling station is in operation during spring, summer and fall. Continuing down trail a path ascends stone steps up a hill to a composting toilet. From 1 1/2 Mile Resthouse the view of Grand Canyon is dominated by steep slopes and shear cliffs. The canyon walls of alternating red, white, and yellow rise a thousand feet about you, while the stair stepped cliffs and slopes of red rock drop away below you to a distant green plateau of rock and plants some 2,000 feet below you. In the center of the plateau a small pocket of dark green trees marks Indian Garden, a campground and day use area within the canyon. A distance white trail cuts across the plateau from the trees to point above a steep walled canyon of black rock at the very bottom of Grand Canyon. Across the inner gorge peaks and valleys of carved layered rock rise up to North Rim of Grand Canyon.",

Beginning 1,000 feet (305 m) higher than South Rim trails, hikers can glimpse the vast expanse of Bright Angel Canyon through fir trees, aspen, ferns and wildflowers.<br /> <br /> Built throughout the 1920s to match the quality and grade of the South Kaibab Trail, the present-day North Kaibab Trail replaced an older route infamous for crossing Bright Angel Creek 94 times (the present-day trail crosses only 6 times). Though masterfully constructed and maintained, North Kaibab Trail is challenging for day hikers as well as rim-to-rim hikers.</span></p> <h3>Day Hike Turnaround Points</h3> <p><strong>North Kaibab Trailhead</strong>\u00a0(8,241 feet / 2,510 m)<br /> Be sure to pick up a map before hiking.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Overlook</strong>\u00a0(7,450 feet / 2,270 m)<br /> 1.4 miles (2.3 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 vertical feet (241 m)<br /> <br /> <strong>Supai Tunnel </strong>(6,840 feet / 2,085 m)<br /> 4.0 miles (6.4 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1400 vertical feet (425 m)<br /> Note: the composting toilet at Supai Tunnel is closed for renovation between April 6, and May 6, 2025.<br /> <br /> <strong>Redwall Bridge</strong>\u00a0(6,040 feet / 1,840 m)<br /> 5.2 miles (8.4 km)<strong> roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2200 vertical feet (670 m)<br /> <br /> Check with a park ranger before attempting to hike past Redwall Bridge and back in one day.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>During the season, water stations are available at North Kaibab trailhead and North Rim Backcountry Information Center. Potable water may also be available at Manzanita Rest House and Cottonwood Campground. Water is NOT available at Roaring Springs and during 2025, Supai Tunnel,. Never fully rely on these water stations, as pipeline breaks and freezing weather impact them. Always carry a way to treat water from the creek in case water stations are not functioning.<br /> <br /> Prior to beginning your hike, check our <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a></strong> webpage. If you are on the North Rim, stop by the Visitor Center/Rager Roost, or the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/north-rim-backcountry-information-center.htm\">Backcountry Information Center</a> (in the North Rim Admin Building) for water status updates.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>After an initial steep descent down the head of a side canyon via a series of numerous switchbacks through lush greenery and impressive views below the trailhead, the trail approaches the distinctive Supai Tunnel. Here hikers will find potable water (mid-May to mid-October) and pit toilets. No emergency phone is available.<br /> <br /> Switchbacks continue to the massive cliffs of Redwall Limestone, where for long stretches the trail has been blasted out of the cliff. The Redwall section is awe-inspiring in every way; fantastic exposure and views contrast with the engineering marvel of providing access to this location.<br /> <br /> From Redwall Bridge, the bulk of the trail's descent meets the flatter bottom of Bright Angel Canyon and Roaring Springs. Here, water gushes forth directly out of the cliffs, cascading over moss and fern to form Bright Angel Creek (which will be a constant companion all the way to the Colorado River). This giant spring provides drinking water for every visitor and resident within Grand Canyon National Park. The water is delivered to the South Rim via a pipeline buried beneath the North Kaibab Trail (installed 1965 - 1970). You can see this amazing pipeline as it stretches across the Colorado River on the underside of the Silver Bridge from Bright Angel Trail.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Please consider seasonal variations in trail conditions.\u00a0</strong><br /> <br /> During winter months, the upper section of North Kaibab trail can be ice-covered and snowbound. North Rim hikers must be prepared for extreme winter conditions with extra food, clothing layers, and tractions devices.<br /> <br /> During hotter months (May - September), it is critical that hikers begin their hike well before dawn or after 3 p.m. Success and enjoyment depends on the amount of time spent planning ahead and preparing for all conditions. Success in the summer can be as simple as staying off the trail and out of the sun between 10 am-4 pm. Hiking the entire North Kaibab Trail in a single day is not recommended, particularly in summer, as it would be extremely difficult to avoid hiking in the heat of the day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your itinerary with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes **hyponatremia **-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules & Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and the death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the direction of the wrangler.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for camping in this area. Learn more and how to apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\"><strong>online</strong></a>\u00a0\u2014or if you are visiting the South Rim, ask a ranger at\u00a0Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> At-large camping is not permitted on the North Kaibab Trail; camp is only permitted in designated campgrounds.</p> <h3>Maps</h3> <p>Hiking Into Grand Canyon (NPS, free)<br /> 7.5 Minute Quad, Phantom Ranch (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 9, North Kaibab Trailhead. 3 \u00bd minutes. The parking lot for the North Kaibab Trailhead is located along the east side of Route 67, a little over two miles (three and a half kilometers) north of Grand Canyon Lodge. Two wildlife-proof metal garbage cans and bicycle rack stand at the foot of a one-way road that loops right uphill around a long, slender lot with diagonal parking spaces. Note at the top of the lot, there is a wheelchair accessible vault toilet, and another wildlife-proof metal garbage can. Also note there is a mule pen above the lot. A long, wood-post lined bridle path leads downhill from the pen, alongside and parallel to the long south side of the lot, and continues past the North Kaibab trailhead at the foot of the lot. At the base of the lot, close to Route 67, move south up a curb onto a six foot (two meter) wide stone landing lined with boulders on either side at the top of a stone staircase. Continue down five roughhewn, uneven stone steps onto the dirt and gravel ground. Note a water filling station to the left at the base of the stone staircase. Sitting atop a low, rectangular stone base, an image of a rock wall in Grand Canyon fills the face of a four foot (one and half meter) square metal panel, with three water spigots protruding from its face. From the base of the stone staircase, continue about 15 feet (five meters) forward to an eight-foot (two-and-a-half meter) tall, double-sided, wooden wayside with a small shingle roof sitting atop a three-foot tall by four-foot wide (90 by 120 centimeter) stone base. The wayside sits in a large, dirt and gravel open area, lined with a two-foot tall boulder wall. Note a number of trails all converge at this location. The Bridle Path continues alongside the roadway to the west, the Arizona Trail on the other side of the road leads north, and the North Kaibab Trail leads south to the Coconino Overlook, Supai Tunnel, Redwall Bridge, and the Manzanita Springs Day Use Area. The front face of the wayside, entitled \u201cNorth Kaibab Trail,\u201d tells the story how the North Kaibab Trail came to be. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. The back face of the wayside, entitled \u201cA Matter of Feet,\u201d discusses how the interrelated factors of elevation, temperature, precipitation, soil depth, and sunlight determine where plants grow in the canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. About 15 feet (five meters) beyond the wayside is a metal, six-foot tall, double-panel information panel. The left-hand panel details the trail\u2019s elevation profile. Beside an aerial photograph of the trail at right, information at the left lists the distances, elevations, and water sources of points along the trail. At the bottom left, it provides detailed hiking information specific to Grand Canyon. On the right-hand panel, a map at the left shows the trail\u2019s path down to Phantom Ranch, above a second view of the large elevation changes as you move along the trail. At the right, Hike Smart tips instruct how to take care of yourself on the trail, above a primer on Trail Courtesy at the lower right. Sub-Script North Kaibab Trail Wayside Panel A title at the top left of the panel reads, \u201cNorth Kaibab Trail.\u201d An illustration beneath the text shows an Indigenous American standing on a rocky outcropping, pointing across the vast Grand Canyon. A sepia tone photograph of a section of the Bright Angel Fault fills the bottom of the panel. Text at the middle left reads: Whether you hike just a mile or go rim-to-rim, you are among a long lineage of North Rim hikers, beginning with American Indians thousands of years ago. In 1902, when cartographer Francois Matthes began mapping the canyon there was no rim-to-rim trail here, even though tourists had been coming to the South Rim since the 1890s. Matthes had to swim his horses across the Colorado River to reach the north side, and then it took him and his crew six days to reach the North Rim on the Kaibab Plateau, where you stand. In 1906, David Rust and crew, hired by the Grand Canyon Transportation Company, built the original rim-to-rim connector trail\u2014then considered an extension of Bright Angel Trail. His trail began at the head of Bright Angel Canyon, crossed the river by cable car, and connected with the Bright Angel Trail on the south side. By 1928, the National Park Service completed the present trail route from here to Roaring Springs and renamed it the North Kaibab Trail. A series of six inset photographs fill the right two-thirds of the panel. Beginning at the top left, the first black-and-white photograph shows a man standing atop a rocky outcropping beside a massive, triangular wooden brace. A metal cage hangs from cables that extend across the canyon towards a high mountain wall in the background. A caption reads: David Rust, in 1910, stands with his cable car, which made crossing the Colorado River possible for visitors. Moving to the right, a second black-and-white photograph shows an elevated view of three, wooden buildings alongside a riverbank at the base of the canyon. A caption reads: The Santa Fe Railway built Phantom Ranch in 1922 for the Fred Harvey Company, replacing Roosevelt Camp. In the center of the wayside, a third black-and-white photograph shows two men standing atop a rocky rise surrounded by desert scrub, next to a small table with a scope, and a shade umbrella. The man at the left writes in a notebook. A caption reads: Francois Matthes (left) and crew member mapping Grand Canyon on the North Rim, 1904. Matthes made the first topographic map of the canyon. A 1927 quote by Francois Emile Matthes at the top right of the panel reads: In the spring of 1902. . . we began to seek a route across to the north side. But at that time there was no trail across from rim to rim, nor was there a bridge over the Colorado. At the middle right of the panel, beneath this quote, the first of two black-and-white photographs shows an aerial view of two workers hanging on a series of cables stretching across a wide section of the river below. A caption above the photograph reads: The National Park Service began improvements to Rust\u2019s trail in 1920, replacing his cable car with a suspension bridge in 1921, and again, in 1928. A second black-and-white photograph to the right shows two men grooming a trail with rakes and shovels beside a tall, rock wall. A caption above this photograph reads: In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps made many improvements to the trail you enjoy today. Under these two pictures, a final color photograph shows a trail section along the edge of the canyon, underneath a rocky overhang. A caption reads: National Park Service trail crews blasted rock cliffs to carve out sections of the North Kaibab Trail in the 1920s. In the background, across a wide chasm, the colored bands of the various rock layers of the canyon are clearly visible, floor to rim. A Matter of Feet Wayside Panel Color images of the plants that inhabit Grand Canyon at different elevations along the North Kaibab Trail cover the face of this wayside. Entitled, \u201cA Matter of Feet,\u201d text at the middle left reads: As you hike the North Kaibab Trail toward the Colorado River, you pass through many different plant communities. From this trailhead to Phantom Ranch the elevation drops almost 6,000 feet (1,800 m). Notice as you hike downward how temperatures get warmer and the plant communities change\u2014sometimes abruptly. Elevation, temperature, precipitation, soil depth, and sunlight are all interrelated factors that determine where plants grow in the canyon. Here, at 8,250 feet (2,515 m) you are surrounded by a ponderosa pine forest, but drop down the trail to 3,000 feet (900 m) and you are standing in desert scrub. For every 1,000 feet (300 m) you drop in elevation, temperatures rise about 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2\u20133 \u00b0C). This translates to a 20\u201325 degree Fahrenheit (11\u201314 \u00b0C) difference between North Rim and the bottom of the canyon. At the top left, words over an image of an evergreen forest read: Boreal Forest Above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) A mix of conifers like Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and white and blue spruce with patches of grassy meadows. To the right of center at the top, a rectangular inset photograph shows a stand of tall pine trees. A caption reads: Ponderosa Pine 7,200\u20138,300 feet (2,200 \u20132,530 m). Tall, red-barked trees that often grow in pure ponderosa stands. To the left of this image is a circular, inset photograph of a Dusky grouse. It has mottled camouflage pattern of brown, gray, white, and black on its back, with a dark gray tail and blue-gray underparts. It displays purplish-red air sacs on its neck, and a rich red eye comb. To the right is a second circular, inset photograph of a Kaibab squirrel. It has a black belly tinged with gray, a white tail, tufted ears, and a chestnut brown head. Moving down the center of the wayside, a second rectangular inset photograph shows a stand of tall, wide evergreen trees with dark green needles growing alongside additional, bushy evergreens with a rounded crown and many-forked trunks. A caption reads: Pinyon Pine \u2013 Utah Juniper 4,000\u20137,300 feet (1,200\u20132,230 m) Small conifers, or evergreens, growing with Gambel oak, cliffrose, and sagebrush. To the left of this image is a circular, inset photograph of a Scrub jay. Its head, wings, and tail are blue, with a gray underside. It has a white throat with a long tail and small bill. Continuing down the center of the wayside, a third rectangular inset photograph shows low, green plants hugging the rocky soil in the foreground. In the background, the similar vegetation covers the high rocky walls of the canyon. A caption reads: Desert Scrub 1,500\u20134,000 feet (450\u20131,200 m) Low growing, widely spaced shrubs and wildflowers, often dominated by blackbrush. To the left of this image is",

Continue about a tenth of a mile (160 meters) along Admin Loop Road, then make a left to come to the parking lot of a one-story wood building, the Backcountry Information Center. A row of parallel car spaces faces a four-foot wide concrete sidewalk, with a wheelchair accessible spot at the north end. There are three larger RV parking spaces along the west side of the lot. Note at the north end of the sidewalk is another short sidewalk that leads to a water filling station. Set atop a low, rectangular stone base, an image of a rock wall in Grand Canyon fills the front of a four foot (one and half meter) square metal panel, with three water spigots protruding from its face. Note this is the only water station in the park that is open all year round, with one spigot that's operational on the kiosk, and a spigot with a red handle several feet to the right of the panel as well. In front of the building, two diagonal sidewalks leading from the parking area surround a small dirt and gravel area with a tall, metal flagpole in the center. The sidewalks converge under a large, covered outdoor patio. To the left is a large customer service window with a wooden sign above that reads, \u201cBackcountry Reservations,\u201d with a small National Park Service arrowhead logo. The Center provides information, permits, and trip planning assistance for those looking to explore Grand Canyon on day and overnight hikes from the canyon's northern rim. Day hikes do not require permits of any kind, but any overnight trip to the backcountry, whether below the rim or above, requires a permit. You can get information and try for a day-of permit in person here. A large scale hangs to the immediate left of the window. It has a metal pointer set in front of its large, circular face, and a large metal hook below. Numbers around the circumference range from zero to 100 kilograms (zero to 220 pounds). A few feet further along to the right of the reservation window are a set of double metal and glass doors. Outside, beyond the doors, note a free-standing bulletin board at the far end of the walkway in the corner with current information about park conditions. To the right of the bulletin board, note a single door to a gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom.",

      "audioDescription": "From the shuttle bus stop, move 80 feet (24 m) east along a 2-foot (60 cm) high stone wall lining the inside of the asphalt sidewalk to a 3-foot (1 m) wide opening on your left. Move away from the road down three stone steps onto another asphalt sidewalk and proceed 20 feet (6 m) forward to a vast overlook lined with a 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing running left-to-right along the edge of the canyon. At the northernmost corner of a wide promontory, Pima Point provides a vista of over 40 miles (64 km) along Grand Canyon, from Bright Angel Canyon in the east all the way west to Powell Plateau and the Great Scenic Divide. Grand Canyon rock layers are on full display from the 2-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the canyon up through the various layers of sandstone, shale, and limestone all the way up to the rim. Far below, the Colorado River is visible in several places as it winds through deep gorges, including Granite Rapids to the east. Stand still, be quiet, close your eyes. Can you hear the distant roar of the rapids, or the wing beat of a passing raven? Various sections of the Hermit Trail are in view, zigzagging down through rocky buttes, as are the meandering paths of numerous side creeks lined with green vegetation. Debris flows appear in several places on the faces of the canyon walls, evidence of side washes where raging water rushed over cliff edges, triggering avalanches of rock, mud, water, and depositing boulders in their wake\u2014sometimes all the way into the river below.",

Douglas-fir trees thrive in a shielded niche just below the rim where there is sufficient water to sustain their survival. A 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing runs along the rim offering many vistas, beside a small forest of ponderosa pine, and pinyon-juniper woodland. The shaggy, twisty shrub known as cliffrose is also found in this area. It has reddish-brown bark, and blooms persistently and profusely from spring through fall. The blossoms are creamy or yellowish, up to an inch wide and quite fragrant. Listen for birds as this is also a prime bird migratory path across the canyon. The Rim Trail follows the rim from Pipe Creek Vista west to Hermits Rest. The section of the Rim Trail between Pipe Creek Vista and Maricopa Point is paved, and mostly wheelchair accessible.",

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing:\u00a0proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

A two-way shuttle bus stop makes visiting here easy and a nice quick option for those limited on time.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>The story of Grand Canyon as we know it is tied directly to John Wesley Powell.\u00a0As a geologist\u00a0Powell\u00a0grew interested in exploring the unknown canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers. He studied reports from earlier expeditions, but in the late 1800s there wasn't much to go on and most of what was available was inaccurate and jaded by the perceptions of early explorers. Gathering\u00a0support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads,\u00a0educational institutions, and Congress for his expedition down the Green River. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869 to explore the course of the river, fill in the blank spots that littered maps of the southwest, and to gather scientific data.<br /> <br /> After three summer months spent exploring the upper canyons of the Colorado River, the expedition passed the Paria River on August 4 hungry, exhuasted both mentally and physically, and with only musty apples, spoiled bacon, wet flour, and coffee remaining to sustain them they entered the last and greatest of the canyons. The scientific expedition had turned into a fight for their very survival as they entered into Grand Canyon.\u00a0Powell referred to Grand Canyon as \u201c<em>our granite prison</em>\u201d and described an almost unbroken series of rapids that the expedition ran, lined, or portaged, praying all the while for an end to the ordeal. On August 28, the canyon ended and the river became relatively quiet once again. They had survived, and in doing so became the first recorded people to successfully navigate from Green River, Wyoming to the Black Canyon of Arizona/Neveda.<br /> <br /> After a near disatrous first trip that cost\u00a0Powell\u2019s most of his notes and\u00a0scientific data, a few boats, and multiple men,\u00a0he secured\u00a0full federal funding to a second trip. Powell gathered a new\u00a0crew, this time including amateur scientists and educated men, and he\u00a0began a second expedition on May 22, 1871. Between his two trips down the river Powell gathered invaulable information and data and literally helped to put Grand Canyon on a map. Further studies in the area over the next few years, by both Powell and his peers in the geologic community, helped to lay the foundation of how we understand Grand Canyon geology today.\u00a0</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>The Rim Trail is a mostly paved path that stretches roughly 13 miles (21 km) along the southern rim of Grand Canyon from South Kaibab Trailhead in the east to Hermits Rest in the west. Most people won't hike the whole trail in one go, but walking short sections of the rim\u00a0can provide an excellent chance to stretch the legs after a long car ride, take a break from riding the shuttle, or to get away from a busy viewpoint for a moment. No matter how much of it you walk, you'll get lots of good views along the way!<br /> <br /> <strong>One-way Distances from Mather Point along the Rim Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> South Kaibab Trail - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum - 0.7 miles (1 km)<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Bright Angel Trailhead - 2.5 miles (4 km)<br /> Hermits Rest - 11 miles (18 km)</p> <h2>Popular Sections</h2> <h4>Mather Point to Yavapai Geology Museum</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 0.7 mi (1 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong>: </span>15\u201330 minutes<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade.\u00a0<br /> <br /> This short\u00a0section of the trail is one of the most popular as it is easily accessible from both Mather and Yavapai Points and it offers constant views of Grand Canyon, as well as Phantom Ranch and a glimpse of the Colorado River far below. Even walking part of this section guarentees some great Grand Canyon vistas.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0When the Kaibab/Rim (Orange) Route shuttle bus\u00a0is running to Mather Point and the Yavapai Geology Museum it links the two ends of this section for an easy one-way hike.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h4>Mather Point to Grand Canyon Historic Village</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 2.5 mi (4 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong></span>: 45 minutes to 2 hours<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibbility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. (It is largely downhill heading east to west from Mather to the Village)<br /> <br /> This 2.5 mile stretch of the Rim Trail includes the section above, and\u00a0expands it west to include the trail to/from\u00a0the historic village.\u00a0While you can walk this section in under an hour it is recommended to plan for a longer trip as you'll want to take your time to appreciate all the good views, snag a few pictures,\u00a0and experience the Trail of Time, which overlaps this section of the rim. The 2 mile\u00a0(3.5 km) section between Yavapai Geology Museum and the Grand Canyon Historic Village can be hot and sunny in the summer time so\u00a0be sure to take water, snacks, and sun protection. Water and restrooms\u00a0are\u00a0available at the Geology Museum, Grand Canyon Visitor and at multiple spots in the village. This section of the trail is quite popular as well, but offers more opportunities for solitude and quiet moments along the canyon's edge.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Village (Blue) Route shuttle bus\u00a0is running transportation will run between the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village to help complete a one-way loop.\u00a0</p> <h4>Grand Canyon Historic Village to Hermits Rest</h4> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Length</span>:\u00a0</strong>7 mi (11 km) one way<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Time:</span>\u00a0</strong>3+ hours<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Accessibility:</span> </strong>The section between Monuement Creek Vista and Pima Point is paved and accessible, but the rest of the Rim Trail along the Hermit Road is <strong>NOT</strong> accessible. The rest of the trail is a mix of dirt and paved paths with\u00a0the paved sections including\u00a0steep grades and steps.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The views along this section of the Rim Trail offer some of the best views of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road and can help get you away from the crowds at the major viewpoints along the way. There is limited water and restrooms availability along the Hermit Road so be prepared for longer hikes. Most hikers will use the shuttle system to jump along the road to\u00a0do shorter sections of the trail and to return to the beginning of the scenic road. <i>Most</i>\u00a0of the stops are about 1 mile from each other, though a few are longer, check your <strong>Pocket Map</strong> for a break down of the Rim Trail from point to point.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Hermit Rest (Red) Route shuttle bus is running it will stop at each of the major viewpoints and access points along the Rim Trail through this section.\u00a0</p> <h4><span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">Safety - Hike Smart</span></h4> <p>- Take water, snacks, and sun protection with you on your hike. At 7,000 ft (2000 m) in elevation even a hike on the rim can leave you dehydrated, tired, and sun burnt.\u00a0<br /> - Stay on designated trails and walkways and always keep a safe distance of at least six feet (2 m) from the edge of the canyon rim.<br /> - In areas where there is a railing or fence, do not climb over the barrier.<br /> - Know where the edge is. Watch foot placement and look for trip hazards.<br /> - Never throw rocks, coins, trash, or anything else over the edge.<br /> - Early summer temperatures can be HOT. Highs will often reach the low to mid 90s <sup>o</sup>F (...<sup>o</sup>C) and even the canyon rim can reach temperatures above 100<sup>o</sup>F\u00a0(38<sup>o</sup>C). Check the weather and be prepared.<br /> - The late summer season brings rain and thunderstorms to Grand Canyon. Remember, \"If it roars, Go indoors\".\u00a0Lightning can and often does strike the edge of the canyon as thunderstorms pass over the area.\u00a0</p>",

He is also said to have rode a mule down the Bright Angel Trail in 1903 to tell the Havasupai people they had to leave their home, now Indian Garden, to create a National Park.<br /> <br /> During his first visit to Grand Canyon in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed, \"Leave it as it is. You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.\"<br /> <br /> On June 8, 1906, Roosevelt signed into legislation the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a> , which enabled the President \"...to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments..\"<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1908, Roosevelt officially recognized the significance of Grand Canyon by using this same order to proclaim it a national monument. In 1919, three years after the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, it was officially designated as a national park.<br /> <br /> In his time as President of the United States, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTeddy' used his authority to protect wildlife and public lands in unprecedented fashion. He created the United States Forest Service (USFS) in 1905 and established 150 national forests. In addition, Roosevelt also authorized the creation of 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments under the Antiquities Act. In total, Theodore Roosevelt protected approximately 230 million acres of public land.<br /> <br /> Today, the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, both positive and negative, is found across the country. There are six national park sites dedicated, in part or whole, to our conservationist president. You can find more information about these places, including North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park, under these <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-related-web-sites.htm\">related websites</a> .</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 5, Roosevelt Point. 2 \u00bc minutes. Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, just under two miles (three kilometers) beyond Vista Encantada, a small pullout to the left leads to a one-lane parking area. A three-foot (one meter) wide asphalt sidewalk runs along the side of the road on the canyon side. In the center of the sidewalk, a paved central path leads east to a large boulder at the right with a roughly two foot (60 cm) square metal plaque affixed to its front. At the top left of the plaque is a three-dimensional image of Theodore Roosevelt with a bushy mustache and eyebrows, wearing a monocle. Text on the plaque reads: ROOSEVELT POINT Named in honor of the 26th President of the United States for his efforts towards the preservation of the Grand Canyon. A 1903 quote on the plaque by Theodore Roosevelt reads: Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it. What you can do is keep it for your children, for your children\u2019s children, and for all that come after you, as the one great sight which every American \u2026 should see. Moving about 20 feet (six meters) past the boulder, down a slight incline, the paved path leads past a wooden bench at the right, ending at a narrow dirt and gravel border in front of a line of boulders along the rim. Note there is also a small, wood-covered shelter set over the boulders to the right. To the left of the central path, a wayside panel mounted on a three-foot (one meter) tall angled, metal reading rail along the line of boulders talks about how the uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At the north end of the small roadside parking area, a short trail leads downhill to several wooden benches at the Roosevelt Point viewpoint. The upper end of a long, thin ridge extends four miles (six and a half kilometers) eastwards, descending several thousand feet in a series of mesas and buttes. Sub-Script Big Step Down Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Roosevelt Point fills the face of the panel. Entitled \u201cBig Step Down,\u201d words at the top left read: Looking east from Roosevelt Point, the opposite side of Grand Canyon lies far below. This entire region, 75 million years ago, was a smooth plain stretching off to the east. About five million years later, that landscape began to change. North America drifted westward, squeezing the western landscape, and the land began to rise. Far to the east, the Rocky Mountains folded and buckled skyward. Here, on the Colorado Plateau, the uplift was smoother. Even so, the Kaibab Plateau where you stand was pushed about 2,400 feet (732 m) higher than the Marble Platform to the east, creating a big step down. In the center of the panel, a white circle surrounds a portion of the Marble Platform far off in the distance, with a white line connecting to a circular, inset color photograph of that location. In the photograph, a clearly identifiable fault line runs between steep, rocky walls. A caption reads: Sharp eyes or binoculars help you spot the fault line separating the Kaibab Plateau from the Marble Platform. Here the normally flat rock layers of the canyon were bent upward, showing where the big step rose vertically over the Butte Fault. Text at the lower left of the panel reads: The uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. Here, at Roosevelt Point, we stand 2,400 feet (732 m) above Marble Platform and more than 8,400 feet (2,560 m) above sea level.",

This can be a great trail for short trips into the canyon of half a day or less, but the openness of this trail lends itself to extreme heat during the summer months and little to no protection from passing storms.<br /> <br /> There is little shade, and what is there comes mostly from the canyon walls at the very beginning of the trail in the early part of day.<br /> <br /> There is <b>no water</b> along the trail, though there is a spring-fed water filling station at the trailhead during the summer.<br /> <br /> <b>No private vehicles allowed at the trailhead. Access is by foot, bicycle, or shuttle bus only.</b><br /> <br /> *Note: all trails into the canyon are steep and difficult; consider contacting a park ranger before starting your hike.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>Ooh Aah Point</strong><br /> 1.8 miles (2.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 feet (230 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Cedar Ridge</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,120 feet (340 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Skeleton Point\u00a0</strong>- Check with a park ranger before attempting as a day hike.<br /> 6 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2,040 feet (620 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking below Skeleton Point is not recommended as a day hike due to the long distance, extreme temperature changes, and an approximately 5,000-foot (1,500 m) elevation change each way. Consult a park ranger before heading further down for safety tips and overnight permits.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The Tipoff</strong><br /> 9 miles (14.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,280 feet (1,100 m) elevation change<br /> <strong>NOTE: The South Kaibab Trail is CLOSED between the Tipoff and the Colorado River/Black Bridge (updated\u00a0August 20, 2025).\u00a0</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Phantom Ranch (CLOSED)</strong><br /> 15 miles (24 km)\u00a0<strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2 days / 4,700 ft (1,430 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>There is no water on the South Kaibab Trail. From early May to mid-October there is water near the trailhead (from a spigot near the bus stop). Potable water is available year round at Bright Angel Campground, however, please note that due to occasional pipeline breaks water at Bright Angel Campground is not guaranteed: bringing an alternative form of water treatment, such as iodine tablets or a water filter, is essential. During hot weather, take at least 4 liters of water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Hikers seeking panoramic views unparalleled on any other trail at Grand Canyon will want to consider a hike down the South Kaibab Trail. It is the only trail at Grand Canyon National Park that so dramatically holds true to a ridgeline descent. But this exhilarating sense of exposure to the vastness of the canyon comes at a cost: there is little shade and no water for the length of this trail.<br /> <br /> During winter months, the constant sun exposure is likely to\u00a0keep most of the trail relatively free of ice and snow. For those who insist on hiking during summer months, which is not recommended in general, this trail is the quickest way to the bottom (it has been described as \"a trail in a hurry to get to the river\"), but due to lack of any water sources, ascending the trail can be a dangerous proposition.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>Hikers must use the park's free shuttle bus system to reach the trailhead. Every morning, three hiker express buses leave from the Bright Angel Lodge and then from the Backcountry Information Center (times vary depending on the month). Otherwise, hikers will need to park at Grand Canyon Visitor Center and take the South Kaibab (Orange) shuttle bus.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and the death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:<span style=\"background-color: var(--bs-body-bg); color: var(--bs-body-color); font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family); font-size: var(--bs-body-font-size); font-weight: var(--bs-body-font-weight); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">\u00a0</span></p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the direction of the wrangler.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.\u00a0</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for backcountry camping in this area.

      "bodyText": "<p>This historic trail is the primary access for hikers into eastern Grand Canyon. It ranks as <b>one of the most difficult and demanding developed trails</b> in the park.<br /> <br /> The Tanner Trail is <b>steep</b>, <b>rarely maintained</b>, and <b>not a recommended first hike into the canyon</b>. The only source of water is at the Colorado River. In general, Grand Canyon is infamous for summer heat\u00a0and the Tanner Trail is noted for being unusually hot.<br /> <br /> The summer sun rises early and sets late in this wide-open area. The absence of water produces sparse vegetation and little shade. River runners call this part of the Grand Canyon \"Furnace Flats\".<br /> <br /> Avoid this trail during warm/hot weather over 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C).</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p><strong>Strongly consider talking with a park ranger before attempting this hike.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail is <strong>steep</strong> and <strong>no water is available until the river</strong>. Expect to hike and climb over unstable footpaths and boulder fields. Your best option for a day hike would be to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. To reach just this point, be prepared for 1.6 miles (2.6 km) over a descent of 1,700 feet (518 m). Hiking beyond the 75 Mile Creek Saddle is exposed and can be extremely hot.<br /> <br /> There are no water sources along the trail until the Colorado River, a 9 mile trek (14.5 km) and elevation change of 4,650 feet (1,417 m) each way. The elevation at Lipan Point is 7,350 feet (2,240 m) and at the Colorado River it is 2,700 feet (823 m). However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult and time-consuming to purify.<br /> <br /> If you choose to hike down what remains of a pioneer-era trail, you will head immediately down the gully east of Lipan Point. The upper section of the Tanner Trail is narrow, badly eroded, and can be difficult to follow, especially after a storm. The trail stays on the slopes east of the bottom of the gully through the Toroweap Formation and switches to the west side at the top of the Coconino Sandstone. Rockslides in the Coconino Sandstone have covered the original trail in places, forcing hikers to improvise short sections. The trail descends steeply across the slope west of the bed of gully nearly all the way to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. A prime canyon view at the saddle is the reward for a couple of miles of notably unstable hiking. The reward comes with a price - hiking out of the canyon from even here is one of the more rugged, steeper climbs in the park.<br /> <br /> Hiking beyond this point requires detailed planning and experience hiking in a desert environment.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>The Colorado River is the sole source of water. No reliable water exists above the shoreline. The Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify under those conditions.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>Parking is available at Lipan Point. Walk back down the road a short ways and look for the trailhead, east of the pavement.<br /> <br /> It is 9 miles (14.5 km) from Lipan Point at 7,350 feet (2,240 m) to the Colorado River down at 2,700 feet (823 m). \u00a0All water should be treated or boiled. However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms.

Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts.

Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>,\u00a0a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The lower reaches of Grand Canyon below Desert View are dominated by a series of tilted layers of stone known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. The Supergroup is a complex collection of ancient sedimentary and igneous rocks ranging in age from 729 million to 1.255 billion years, the oldest sedimentary deposits in the canyon.\u00a0The colorful rocks are soft and easily eroded so the canyon floor is unusually expansive, offering unimpeded views of some of the steepest walls to be found below the rim.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>American Indians used this natural rim-to-river route for several thousand years. The trail as we know it today has been in use since 1890, when Franklin French and Seth Tanner improved it. This work allowed early miners access to their claims; it was also used as the southern component of the disreputable Horsethief Route.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for backcountry camping in this area. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website</a> or request permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> As part of conservation efforts to salvage plant and animal habitats that depend upon remnants of older pre-dam sediments near the Colorado River, <strong>the large sand dune at the mouth of Tanner Canyon is closed to visitation and camping</strong>. <strong>Tanner Canyon use area (BB9) is the only exception</strong> , allowing \"at-large\" camping. There are nice (although dry) established campsites along the trail at Seventyfive Mile Creek-Tanner Canyon saddle, trailside in the Supai Formation, above and below the Redwall Limestone, and in the Tapeats Sandstone. Campsites near the Colorado River can be found on the east side of Tanner Canyon. A composting toilet is nearby.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Desert View Quad (USGS)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)</p>",

The golden \"magic meter\", on the ground next to the rock column, represents all the things that you saw on the Million Year Trail.<br /> <br /> The uppermost layered Paleozoic rocks of Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone, are the theme for the seating rocks and paving stones of this portal. See if you can find the proto-reptile tracks visible in several of the slabs of Coconino Sandstone used for this portal's paving stones. In the seating rocks surrounding the portal, look for gastropod fossils in the pieces of Kaibab limestone or take a closer look at the fine layering of sand grains in the large pieces of Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> To the west, look for a wayside exhibit explaining how long it took for the Colorado River to carve Grand Canyon. Touch the river-polished rock!</p> <h3>Trail of Time Overview</h3> <p>The Trail of Time is the world's largest geoscience exhibition at one of the world's grandest geologic landscapes, Grand Canyon National Park. The trail utilizes the unique vistas and rocks of Grand Canyon to help visitors ponder, explore, and understand the magnitude of geologic time and the stories encoded by Grand Canyon rocks and landscapes. Geologic time is immensely long. The 4.56 km (2.8 mi) trail is marked every meter, with 1 meter = 1 million years of our 4,560,000,000 year-long Earth history. Viewing tubes, rocks on plinths, and wayside panels help visitors connect the rocks visible in Grand Canyon to their place along the timeline.<br /> <br /> The main Trail of Time can be entered at different points - including the east end near Yavapai Point (young end), west end at Grand Canyon Village (old end), or a middle point where a connecting trail comes from the Park Headquarters parking area (Parking Lot A). Shuttle stops connect each entry point, so you can walk it in several ways and still get back to your car. The entry portals have messages on each side appropriate for those approaching (welcome) or for those completing different segments of the Trail (congratulations).<br /> <br /> Located on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, the Trail of Time extends along the paved Rim Trail between the Yavapai Geology Museum on the east and Maricopa Point on the west. The main portion of the Trail between Yavapai Geology Museum and Grand Canyon Village is accessible to wheelchairs and baby strollers, and it is convenient to shuttle bus stops and parking areas in a heavily-visited section of the park.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Trail of Time is a 3.1 mile (5 km) wheelchair accessible interactive trail that winds along the rim on a wide, relatively level paved surface. Along the side of the trail, low concrete pedestals display actual Grand Canyon rocks in a timeline of the canyon's geologic history. Bronze markers embedded in the sidewalk indicate at what point in time you are standing. Moving west along the trail from the Yavapai Geology Museum, a six-foot (2 m) tall by four-foot (1.2 m) wide V-shaped rock column shows Grand Canyon's actual rock layers, brought up from deep in the canyon. Touch the column to feel the layers: the oldest black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom, topped by multi-colored diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, followed by more horizontal layers of rock with the Kaibab Formation at the top. Text on the east side of a three-foot (1 m) tall by two-foot (60 cm) wide panel embedded in the column reads: \"Congratulations! You have just walked a million years. Now you are ready to walk a 2 billion-year timeline of Grand Canyon geology.\" An illustration at the bottom of the panel shows three people on the trail underneath a map of the Trail of Time along the rim of Grand Canyon. Text reads: \"One long step = 1 million years.\" Two highlighted markers at their feet read \"Today\" at the bottom right, and \"1 million years ago\" a bit to the left. In the center of the panel, a map shows the route of the Trail of Time along the rim. Text in a yellow box at the right of the map reads, \"You Are Here,\" pointing to a location just west of Yavapai Geology Museum at the far right. Maricopa Point is at the left, to the west. The map shows shuttle bus stops and parking lot locations, and the locations of several restrooms. At the top of the map, small bits of blue show the Colorado River flowing at the bottom of the canyon. Text on the opposite west side of the panel reads: \"Congratulations! You have just walked a 2 billion-year timeline of Grand Canyon geology. Now see what happened in the last million years.\" An illustration at the bottom of the panel underneath the same map shows a middle-aged couple on the trail, as a young man and woman walk east toward Yavapai Point, markers at their feet now only 100,000 years apart. Moving west along the trail from the Yavapai Geology Museum, one meter (3 foot) long bronze bar is embedded in the path on the ground in front of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. An illustration in the center of the panel matches the bar in the ground. The word \"Today\" appears at the far right of the bar, which is divided up into ten equal segments of 100,000 years ending with the words, \"One Million Years Ago\" at the far left. Text across the top of the panel reads: This bronze meter represents the last million years. Next to an arrow pointing left, text continues: \"Walk this way to feel how long 2,000 million (2 billion) years is. One long step = 1 million years.\" Next to an arrow pointing to the right, text reads: \"Walk this way to see what happened in the last million years.\" An illustration on the panel underneath the bar depicts the Trail of Time along the South Rim with the word \"Today\" at the far right, near the Yavapai Geology Museum. Midway along the trail, the park headquarters portal is 1,000 million years ago. At The Village, you will have moved 1.2 miles (2 km) or 2,000 million years along the timeline. Wrapping around the rim to Maricopa Point, you will have moved the Earth's age, 4,560 million years.",

Considered sacred by many, this is a nurturing land, a place of spiritual and physical enrichment. Please respect this place as you would your own home. Disturbing the site or walking off trail destroys valuable information and is also illegal. Please help the National Park Service protect this natural and cultural environment for future generations.</p> <h4>History</h4> <p>This pueblo\u00a0is one of more than 6000 archaeological/cultural sites recorded in the park. Dendrochronology (tree ring dating, indicate\u00a0people began construction of Tusayan Pueblo around 1185 CE. The style of buildings and household and ceremonial items associated with the site are typical of the ancestral Puebloan culture.The people who lived here and in other sites throughout the Southwest are\u00a0the ancestors of the modern Hopi and Pueblo communities of eastern Arizona and the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico. The history of these people and their culture is interpreted through physical objects such as the pueblo itself, and the stories of their descendants which have been passed down from generation to generation.To learn more about the history of this site, join a park ranger on a guided walk during the summer season, and/or by visiting tribal lands and learning from the people who carry the stories of their ancestors who occupied the area physically, and are still here spiritually.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "About 20 feet (6 m) east along the asphalt path from the Tusayan Museum building, the path opens out to form a loop around a wooded area directly ahead, edged with limestone rocks. At front of the loop, a four-foot (1.2 m) tall limestone pedestal displays a three-foot (1 m) wide by two-foot (60 cm) tall angled metal reading panel. To the right is a small brown metal box with a slanted and hinged metal lid on a three-foot (1 m) tall rectangular metal post. Text on the panel reads: Tusayan Ruin Trail Allow about 30 minutes to tour Tusayan Ruin. The 0.1-mile loop trail through the main ruin is paved and wheelchair-accessible; the side loop to a prehistoric farming site is not. Signs along the way explain the site's features. An interpretive trail guide with greater detail about Tusayan's inhabitants is available to your right. Tusayan Ruin is a remnant of a small village of about 20 people who lived here for 25 to 30 years in the late 1100s. The architecture was typical for that period. Pueblo architecture varies according to availability of local materials. Here, builders used limestone blocks held together with mud. The name \"Tusayan\" was the Spanish name for this geographic area, and was given to the ruin by archeologists who excavated the site in 1930. A color illustration fills the right-hand side of the panel, showing dozens of men, women, and children around a rectangular, one-story stone structure. Wooden posts stick out along the roof line, and long wooden ladders protrude out of several square holes in the top. A smooth-walled, one-story circular structure with a rocky base sits in a clearing behind the first building. A wooden ladder sticks up from a single square hole in the center of the roof. A map at the left show the layout of the ruins ahead and the locations of the living quarters, kiva, storage rooms, and farming area. At the bottom right is a small black dot with the words, \"You Are Here.\" An arrow at the bottom left points left to the start of the trail. Note there are a couple metal benches along the trail as well.",

After winding through the forest on Ken Patrick Trail for 0.9 miles (1.5 km), bear right and walk for another 0.4 miles (0.6 km). At this point, you have the option of heading left or right. Either direction is part of the same loop on this trail. Both lead to a point overlooking the canyon and North Kaibab Trail switchbacks. The entire loop portion for this section of the trail is 2.1 miles (3.4 km).<br /> <br /> This trail is also used by mules. Always give them the right of way.<br /> <br /> <strong>The eastern section of Ken Patrick trail beyond the junction for Uncle Jim Trail is not maintained and impassable in multiple areas.</strong></p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong>\u00a04.7 miles (7.6 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong>\u00a0~730 feet (~223 m)<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong>\u00a03 hours</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00c2\u00b0F (0\u00c2\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Before it was a park, Grand Canyon was set aside and managed as a Game Reserve by the USFS in 1906. At that time, the wildlife management plan sought to protect grazing animals by removing the predators.<br /> <br /> James T. \"Uncle Jim\" Owens was a warden for the US Forest Service (USFS) who lived in a cabin on the rim while carrying out his duties in the reserve. Uncle Jim is credited with killing 532 mountain lions from the North Rim.</p>",

The first 3 miles of the trail meander back and forth along the rim of Transept Canyon, so turning around within that portion makes for a lovely round trip hike that is less than 6 miles. If you choose to hike to Widforss Point at the end of the trail, you'll be rewarded with a unique and expansive view.<br /> <br /> This trail is accessed from a dirt road 0.25 miles (0.4 km) south of the highway junction to Cape Royal and Point Imperial. Take this road 1.0 mile (1.6 km) to the gravel parking area.<br /> <br /> No dogs are allowed.<br /> <br /> More\u00a0information: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/Widfross.pdf\">Widforss Trail Brochure</a></p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong>\u00a09.6 miles (15.5 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong>\u00a0~ 1,000 feet (~305 m)<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong>\u00a04-6 hours</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>,<strong>\u00a0</strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>The trail is named after Gunnar Widforss, an early twentieth-century artist from Sweden. He lived and painted at the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, producing a large collection of watercolors prized for their geologic detail. Widforss tried to capture the Grand Canyon environment as he saw it then. That environment has changed over the years as natural and human forces continue to reshape a picture characterized by monumental change through the eons. The geologic features, plant life, and historic features along this trail all provide glimpses of these past and present environments-and future ones as well.<br /> <br /> Previously, Widforss Point had been called McKinnon Point. Colonel H. McKinnon, a British visitor, stopped here in 1892 after a successful hunting trip on the Kaibab Plateau with W.S. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. He left a note in a tin can at the point to commemorate his triumph.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 13, North Rim Forest - Wayside. \u00be minute. About four miles (six point four kilometers) south of the North Rim Entrance Station, the North Rim Picnic Area is located in a small pullout along the east side of Highway 67. A number of picnic tables sit on the west side of the tarmac. On the east side of the pullout, a wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail stands in a grassy area before a grove of trees. Entitled \u201cThe North Rim Forest,\u201d the wayside discusses the marked differences of the forest here compared to that of the South Rim. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. Note a pair of wildlife-proof, metal garbage cans to the right of the wayside. Sub-Script The North Rim Forest Wayside Panel A color photograph of a stand of tall, slender trees with light-colored bark and yellow leaves fills the lower left half of the panel. At the top left, words read: The North Rim Forest The forest that you see here differs markedly from that on the South Rim. The ponderosa pine and pinyon-juniper forest common on the South Rim, and at lower elevations of the North Rim, gives way at higher elevations to the spruce-fir forest you see here. The differences in forest composition are primarily the result of increased moisture at these higher elevations. The South Rim, 7000 feet (2134 meters) above sea level, receives about 15 inches (38 centimeters) of precipitation each year. The spruce-fir forest here on the North Rim, between 8200 and 9200 feet (between 2500 and 2800 meters) above sea level, averages 25 inches (nearly 64 centimeters) a year. Much of that comes as snow. Three smaller color photographs fill the right side of the panel. The top two show the slender white tree trunks and circular yellow and green leaves of the Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). At the lower right, a bushy evergreen is identified in a caption as a Blue spruce (Picea pungens). A list to the left of the bottom photograph reads: Trees characteristic of the North Rim forest include: Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) blue spruce (Picea pungens) white fir (Abies concolor) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)",
