Feel free to explore and handle the rocks and fossils on your own or with a park ranger, but leave them for the next visitor.<br /> <br /> Please do not mark, mar, or otherwise damage the site during your visit. Take only pictures and leave only footprints.<br /> <br /> <b>All fossils within Grand Canyon National Park are protected by federal law and should remain at the site no matter how small or numerous they may seem.<br /> <br /> Watch your step and your head</b>\u00a0when exploring the site. The area is uneven with sudden drops and the branches from the scattered\u00a0trees in the area are better seen than felt.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> *<em>For a bonus challenge try to find where the Bright Angel Fault meets the rim when you are walking\u00a0to or back from the fossil site along the rim trail.</em>\u00a0(<em>Hint: It's betwen the fossil site and Village Route Shuttle Stop)</em></p> <h3>Ranger Programs</h3> <p>A Ranger Program called \"Fossil Discovery Walk\", which visits this site, may be offered in the spring, summer, and fall.<br /> <br /> Check at visitor centers within the park or on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/sr-programs.htm\">website</a> for availability.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "This site is located at the western end of Grand Canyon Village, 300 feet (90 m) west of Hermits Rest Route Transfer along the paved Rim Trail. Twenty feet (6 m) to the canyon side of the trail, a three-foot (1 m) tall by six-foot (2 m) wide square stone altar stands roughly six feet (2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, near the end of a flat, 30-foot (9 m) wide by 60-foot (18 m) long open, pebble-strewn landing. Be mindful stepping over a line of rocks bordering the edge of the asphalt trail onto the loose footing of the landing. Touch the stones that form the altar. Facing north down into the canyon, numerous switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail run up to and past 3-Mile Resthouse, and continue into the distance toward a stand of trees at Indian Garden far below. To the right across the chasm, perched on the edge of the canyon cliffs, is the multi-level dark brown Kolb Studio surrounded by evergreen trees below and behind the building. To the right of the studio, hikers enter and leave the canyon at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Above the trailhead, a few parking lots in the Village sit behind Bright Angel Lodge. The turreted top of El Tovar Hotel rises in the background, high above the rim. Located opposite the Rim Trail Worship Site on the other side of the asphalt path, away from the canyon, is a several-hundred-square-foot (90 meters square) gently-sloping rocky area filled with fossils. Note that once off the Rim Trail, the terrain quickly becomes rough, uneven and rocky, interspersed throughout with prickly pear cactus, juniper, and fir trees. Rocky escarpments stand exposed across the field, some three- to four-feet (1 to 1.2 m) high and tens of feet (10 m) long. On this west side of the Bright Angel Fault line, sedimentary rock layers have been uplifted, exposing an amazing diversity of rock formations with an abundance of fossils and trace fossils hidden within the youngest layer of Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Limestone. Common marine fossils include crinoids, animals that had a column-shaped body, created by a series of discs stacked together, topped by a cup-like head feeding structure radiating out like feathery arms. Shelled marine animals known as brachiopods had two asymmetrical shells, or valves. Several different species of brachiopods can easily be found here.Colonial animals called bryozoans produced lacy structures on hard surfaces or stick structures that stood up in ancient seas. Some solitary coral embedded the pointed end of its horn in the soft sediment for stability with a wider upright cup-like end. Sponge fossils are abundant as well. When they hardened into rock, they are more resistant to erosion and often stick out as large knobs or nodules from the surrounding limestone. Animals burrowed through the soft sediment at the bottom of ancient seas. Look for all manner of preserved burrows that were filled in with sediment. These could be long, short, wide, or thin tubular-looking structures. Many plant fossils also remain, such as small pines and ginkgoes. Most of the plant fossils are impressions called trace fossils, left behind in the mud of an ancient river system. Note that it is illegal to dig up, relocate, and/or remove fossils from Grand Canyon National Park. If you find a fossil, please leave it for others to discover and scientists to study. You are welcome to take a picture or make a drawing of the fossil, then go to one of the visitor centers to see if a park ranger can help you identify it.",

      "audioDescription": "Just inside the front doors of Bright Angel Lodge at the left is a counter to book bus tours, mule rides, and Phantom Ranch reservations. Continue 10 feet (3 m) forward across the stone floor of the lobby to the 25-foot (8 m) long main registration desk at the left. Three massive log pillars spaced evenly across the width of the desk rise 15 feet (4.5 m) high to an exposed timber ceiling. Interior finishes included hand-sawn logs, adobe, and local limestone. Directly opposite the desk, a 10-foot (3 m) wide stone floor corridor leads to a gift shop at the left, a restaurant straight ahead, and a bar at the right. Note that about 8 feet (2.4 m) beyond the far end of the desk is a large, 10-foot (3 m) wide by 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, limestone fireplace with a couple wooden benches at the left and right up a small 6-inch (150 cm) step. Another hallway to the left at the far end of the desk leads to a water fountain and an ATM machine. The Bright Angel History Room is on the right. A set of restrooms is available straight ahead down this hallway and down a small flight of six stairs. Outside, on the canyon side of the lodge, a flagstone bench with a stone slab back rings a planter at the center of a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace. Several other stone benches sit across the terrace, and there is a soda fountain and ice cream shop toward the east side of the building. At the far eastern end of the lodge is the Arizona Room restaurant, with its own separate entrance. From a position facing the Bright Angel Lodge reception desk, move to the far right-hand side of the desk and turn left. Move about 15 feet (4.5 m) forward, and turn right to move across the stone floor, then over a wooden threshold and through a set of eight-foot wide wooden sliding pocket doors onto a carpeted floor. You are in a 25-foot (8 m) wide by 20-foot (6 m) deep room with exposed timbers. The Bright Angel History Room highlights the legacy of Fred Harvey, Mary Jane Colter, and the Santa Fe Railway at Grand Canyon National Park and throughout the Southwest. On the wall to your left and along the left-hand wall are a series of exhibits about Fred Harvey in Arizona. On the wall to your right are a series of exhibits on Harvey at the Canyon, including an open, three-seat carriage with a roof. Four six-foot (2 m) tall floor-standing glass-enclosed display cases in the center left and right of the room display artifacts used and sold in Harvey's company restaurants and gift shops along the Santa Fe main line from Chicago to Los Angeles. A small gift shop and check-out counter sit in the back-right corner. On the opposite side of the room from the door, two five-foot (1.5 m) square picture windows frame a 10-foot (3 m) tall by 10-foot (3 m) wide stone fireplace. Designed by Mary Colter, its construction mirrors a typical cross-section of the canyon's geology. The roughly triangular outline represents the alternating slopes and cliffs seen in the profile of the canyon's walls. Be mindful of the two-inch (5 cm) high dark-stone Vishnu Schist that forms the hearth at the bottom and the metal andirons at the front left and right. Feel how the rock layers of the fireplace mimic the canyon. Touch the diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup next to the fireplace opening, topped by the narrow horizontal layers of the Paleozoic era. The top layer is the Kaibab Formation, the youngest and uppermost layer of rock in Grand Canyon. Five steps at the front left of the one-story limestone brick Bright Angel Lodge lead up under a simple shallow-pitched gable roof, forming a 10-foot (3 m) deep by 50-foot (15 m) wide covered gabled porch supported by peeled log posts. Six large exposed timbers support a triangular sloping shingled roof, 20-feet (6 m) tall at the center over the main entrance. Designed by architect Mary Jane Colter, Bright Angel Lodge is a complex of cabins around a central lodge building, directly on the edge of the canyon. Four windows penetrate the stone fa\u00e7ade of the lodge. Two glass and metal hurricane lamps hang eight-feet (2.4 m) high to the left and right of the main entrance. A brightly painted eight-foot (2.4 m) wide wood and glass vestibule stands in front of the doors with blue and yellow vertical stripes, inlaid with red and white triangles outlined in black. Shed-roofed appendages create a layered effect for the mass of the main lodge. Outside on the canyon side of the lodge, a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace leads right up to a 3-foot (1 m) tall limestone wall on the edge of the rim.",

After his death, the cabin was bought by entrepreneur James Thurber, who owned and operated the nearby Bright Angel Hotel. Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building. The hotel, including Buckey's cabin, was sold to Martin Buggeln in 1901, and was later acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad after the completion of the El Tovar Hotel in 1905. The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge. It remains operating as one of\u00a0Bright Angel Lodge's active guest cabins to this day.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Facing the edge of Grand Canyon, this 1-story cabin built of v-notched wood logs sits on a low stone foundation. The shallow-pitched roof is covered with wood shingles, and there is a native stone chimney at the right.

Touch the sides of the cabin to feel the smooth brown logs. Touch the interweaved logs at the center of the structure and at the corners of the building to feel how the cabin was constructed. A black-and-white photograph of Buckey O'Neill's cabin fills the center of a 3-foot (1 m) tall angled-metal wayside panel. In front of the cabin, a 4-foot (1.2 m) tall 3-rail wooden fence sits perched at edge of the canyon rim. Text at the top left of the panel reads: \"Buckey's Cabin This cabin is the only remaining building from the early pioneer settlement era of Grand Canyon Village.

The consummate entrepreneur, Buckey improved the Bright Angel Trail and camp at Indian Garden and promoted the Grand Canyon railroad to benefit both his tourism and mining interests.\" At the lower left, a quote by Theodore Roosevelt, praising fellow \"Rough Rider\" Buckey O'Neill reads: \"A born soldier, a born leader of men. He was a wild, reckless fellow, soft-spoken, and of dauntless courage and boundless ambition...\u201d A black-and-white photograph inset at the right shows a man in a military uniform with a wide-brimmed hat sitting astride a black horse. Text above and below the picture reads: \"At age 19, Buckey O'Neill's restless spirit drove him from Washington, DC, to the western territories in 1879. There he worked as a lawyer, newspaperman, sheriff, mayor, superintendent of public schools, gambler, miner, congressional candidate, adventurer, and soldier. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Buckey signed up and served as one of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Rough Riders.\" He was killed in action on July 1, 1898.\"",

The small, teardrop-shaped parking area is fine for cars and small RVs, but larger vehicles and those towing trailers will find turning around a bit tight.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Prior to using the land for a cattle ranching venture, Martin Buggeln first became involved with Grand Canyon when he moved here in 1901 from Williams, Arizona. After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A 4-foot (1.2 m) wide asphalt sidewalk rings the parking lot at Buggeln picnic area. Facing away from the lot, a number of picnic tables are available down a short, steep embankment, nestled among several ponderosa pine and Gambel oak trees. Note there is a unisex vault toilet at the far left-hand side of the lot. Along the path in the middle of the parking lot, a color photograph of a stand of Gambel oak trees fills the left-hand side of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top right reads: \"Welcomed Mix Each ponderosa pine forest is unique. Here at Buggeln picnic area ponderosa pine shares the forest with Gambel oak, resulting in a diverse and rich community of plants and animals. Gambel oak shelters wildlife and attracts higher insect populations. Its acorns and foliage feed golden-mantled ground squirrels, wild turkeys, and common porcupines. Decomposing oak leaves improve soil conditions for grasses, wildflowers, and woody shrubs. Experienced birdwatchers consider these forests hot spots for birds. You man spy uncommon birds here, like Grace's and Virginia's warblers. Pine-oak forests are valuable to native people. For centuries, area tribes have gathered a wide array of foods, medicines, and natural dyes in these productive woods.\" Several inset color photographs across the center of the panel show a dark slate gray Northern goshawk with pale-gray barred underparts, a checkered black-and-white downy woodpecker with a small red patch on the back of its head, a small gray and white Virginia's warbler, and a black wild turkey with a red wattle. Other photographs show the small red and yellow flowers of the wax currant, and the small greenish-white to pink flower clusters of the snowberry. Text at the bottom left of the panel reads: \"Gambel oak often associates with ponderosa pine at elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet (1,800-2,400 m). Fires visit this forest every 5 to 7 years. Low-intensity ground fires cycle nutrients into the soil to help this forest combination thrive.\" Next to a picture of a mountain lion at the bottom right, a caption reads: \"Feeding wildlife upsets the balance of this natural forest community. Please don't share your picnic!\"",

      "bodyText": "<p>Many of our national parks have benefited from the hard work of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC), and Grand Canyon is no exception. The park you see today would be much different without the trails, railings, telephone lines, and countless other contributions of \"the boys\" in the 1930s. This site marks where CCC workers built the transcanyon telephone line in 1935. A short walk straight ahead to the stone wall will show you a plaque commemorating their work and give you a view of the old telephone poles.<br /> <br /> Today the transcanyon telephone line has largely been replaced by more modern methods of communication, although short sections of telephone poles installed over 80 years ago are still used today.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Along the Rim Trail near the El Tovar Hotel, a 12- by 14-inch (30- by 35-cm) bronze plaque set in a stone masonry pedestal sits attached to the limestone wall along the edge of the canyon. An inscription reads: \"Trans Canyon Telephone Line built in 1935 by CCC workers, maintained by Mountain Bell, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, by the United States Department of the Interior.\" Peering over the edge of the wall, a two-foot (60 cm) tall galvanized pole can be seen sticking out of the ground with a metal crossbar. A copper wire runs across the top of the crossbar. An old black-and-white picture in the center of a nearby three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel shows a man perched atop a similar, taller steel pole steadied by a second man on the ground. Text at the left reads: \"CCC Legacy. The nearby plaque commemorates an amazing feat achieved by members of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) in the 1930s - construction of a telephone line spanning the entire width of Grand Canyon. One of the poles still stands behind this wall. Beginning in 1934, CCC enrollees worked through winter snow and summer heat to survey and clear a right-of-way roughly following the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. Supplied by pack mules, they set 592 galvanized pipe telephone poles and completed stringing the 18 miles (29 km) of copper-weld wire in 1935.\" A quote from Robert L. Robeson, a CCC Enrollee, at the top right of the panel reads: \"Maybe those mountains are hard to climb. Those trees so hard to cut. But the air is pure, the water fine. And we're climbing right out of the rut...For besides helping ourselves, you see. We are helping Mother and Dad.\" Two additional black-and-white pictures inset at the right of the panel show workers building the stone wall before you, and a line of flat-bed trucks filled with young men. A caption reads: \"At Grand Canyon, today's visitors still benefit from the labor and skills of seven CCC companies. During the Great Depression, these young men constructed trails, roads, walls, fences, reservoirs, fire towers, buildings, power lines, telephone lines, and more.\"",

From there, the Watchtower is in plain view.<br /> <br /> Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Watchtower was constructed in 1932. Architect Mary Colter\u2019s design takes its influences from the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloan people of the Colorado Plateau. This particular tower was patterned after those found at Hovenweep and the Round Tower of Mesa Verde. Colter indicated that it was not a copy of any that she had seen, but rather modeled from several.<br /> <br /> The view from the\u00a0Watchtower provides a unique perspective of the eastern portion of Grand Canyon. From here, looking to the northeast offers a distant glimpse of the Colorado River's transition from the relatively narrow Marble Canyon to the north into the much wider, broader expanse of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> For more about\u00a0what can be seen from here, view\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-point-1956-aviation-accident-memorial.htm\">Desert View Point.</a></p> <h3>The View Room</h3> <p>This lower floor of the tower, the View Room, is modeled after a traditional Native American kiva, and hosts cultural\u00a0demonstrations by indigenous artists during spring, summer and fall. A Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store is also located here.<br /> <br /> Inside the Watchtower View Room, views of the canyon,\u00a0through the different windows, are enhanced by looking through reflectoscopes\u00a0\u2014viewing instruments that use\u00a0polished black glass mirrors to cut\u00a0through the haze and glare of bright sunlight\u00a0and more clearly highlight\u00a0the canyon's multi-colored layers.<br /> <br /> The View Room, which for years was used as retail space, in 2015 was returned to the open area that Mary Colter had intended, because the room was originally designed to be a rest area. It was here that visitors to the canyon in the 1930\u2019s could sit in comfort and have outstanding views of the canyon. The fireplace is unique in that it does not block the view for visitors. Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>\u201cFirst and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.\u201d</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the\u00a0<em>\u201cweathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls\u201d.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company.

      "audioDescription": "As you move north down a gently sloping eight-foot-wide asphalt path, a five-story, 70-foot-tall (21 m) circular stone tower sits perched on the South Rim at the left. Massive, irregularly shaped limestone foundation stones ring the bottom of its 30-foot (9 m) diameter base. Concentric rows of rough rectangular-shaped limestone bricks with weathered faces fill its tapered sides. Log posts stick out through the wall here and there. Trapezoidal-shaped picture windows appear near the top of the tower. Cracks in the walls seem to run through many smaller window openings irregularly disposed along its surface, some of which are themselves irregular in shape, all conveying a partly ruinous appearance. Inlaid in one side is a three-foot (1 m) square limestone plaque of a native snake spirit, and there is open observation area on the roof. Immediately west of the Watchtower, but separated from it by several feet, stands a stone ruin which serves as a storage facility and firewood bin. To the right is an attached one-story, 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular stone kiva, with an observation platform on its roof and large picture windows overlooking the canyon. Magnificent vistas of earth and sky are visible from the many overlooks in, on, and around the tower. Colors blend and change as the sun rises and passes toward the west. The dark night sky allows stars to slowly emerge. Feel the extreme texture in the masonry, and the careful massing of forms that add visual depth and architectural emphasis to the structure. Listen to the winds and canyon creatures all around you. Move from the asphalt sidewalk through a wood-framed doorway and into the stone kiva building onto a flat stone floor. Opposite the door on the far side of the 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular room is a six-foot (2 m) wide stone fireplace. In the center is a smaller four-foot (1.2 m) wide symbolic fire ring, two-feet (60 cm) tall, topped with a ladder to the world above. Visitors are not permitted to climb the ladder. Six eight-foot (2.4 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) tall windows ring the perimeter of the room looking out onto the canyon. Note that the 18-inch (46 cm) deep stone windowsills also serve as seating areas and benches. Notice also that along the side of some of the large windows hang three-foot (1 m) wide by four-foot (1.5 m) tall black reflector scopes in wood log frames. Originally made of highly polished black onyx, they were invented by Claude Lorrain in the 1600s to intensify the color of the image reflected in the scope that gets wiped out by very strong light. Reflecting Grand Canyon's image in the black glass makes the color seem stronger. Above the windows, logs salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel are overlaid horizontally six-feet high in a crisscrossing, cribbed formation around the circular room. Additional horizontal logs form the flat ceiling of the room. Fifteen feet (4.5 m) to the left of the door is a small Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store. Facing the store, 10 feet (3 m) to the right, a stone staircase with a leather-wrapped wooden handrail on the right curves counterclockwise up 22 steps to the first floor of the Watchtower. Note a four-foot (1.2 m) long by four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal handrail mounted to the floor at the base of the stairs that serves to separate foot traffic flowing simultaneously up and down the stairs. Note also a doorway to the left at the top of the stairs that leads out onto the flat roof and observation deck of the circular kiva building.",

At the lower left corner of the panel, a small black rectangle with the words, \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d points to your location on the South Rim near the Village. The canyon extends north across the entirety of the rest of the panel, with the Colorado River winding top to bottom across the face of the panel. The rugged topography of the canyon walls, peaks, creeks and inner canyons continue all the way across to a small white dot in the upper right-hand corner, Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim. Text at the top left of the panel reads: Edge of Vastness Gazing upon this view, one is struck by the canyon's vastness. The mind struggles to comprehend it. Try to describe the canyon's size in words. Try to measure in your mind the canyon's depth, width, and length. Measurements like 1 mile (1.6 km) deep, 18 miles (29 km) wide, and 277 river miles (446 km) long leave us scratching our heads. Perhaps the best we can do is just feel the canyon's enormity. Measure yourself up against it. We are minuscule in comparison, but still, through the keen receptivity of our sense, we can appreciate Grand Canyon's immensity. A second aerial photograph inset at the bottom right shows an even wider view of Grand Canyon. The branch-like arms of the inner smaller canyons extend from the snaky path of the Colorado River. A small section of the map along the river has been highlighted in orange. A caption reads: Standing here, your view (shown in orange) is only a sliver of the whole Grand Canyon. Each Grand Canyon overlook you encounter offers fresh insight, from detailed close-ups of side canyons to sweeping panoramas. Search out and reflect on your favorite view.",

Initially owned and operated by the Fred Harvey company in conjunction with the Santa Fe Railway, many considered it the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi River.<br /> <br /> In 1987, the hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located on Village Loop Drive about 100 feet (30 m) from the South Rim, the El Tovar Hotel blends a Swiss chalet and a Norwegian hunting lodge with a rustic Mission style. Five steps lead up to a broad limestone and pine entry veranda on its east side, extending 40 feet (12 m) across the front of the building. Numerous rocking chairs and benches are set out on its 10-foot (3 m) deep wooden porch. Behind the veranda, the lobby rises three stories tall, topped with an octagonal turret with a pyramid roof. A smaller wooden porch on the north side of the building faces the canyon, and is equipped with a wheelchair ramp. The hotel has many levels. The 200-foot (60 m) long two-story central portion runs roughly parallel with the canyon rim and connects to three-story north and south wings. The top floors of the guest room wings extend only partway from the central section, creating roof decks. The third floor exterior is treated as a mansard, with projecting dormers with shallow gables. The lower portions of the building are mainly of log construction, yielding to a lighter, smoother framed construction sheathed with dark wood planking on the upper levels. The roof is covered in wood shingles. Inside, the central rotunda of the lobby features Swiss-inspired cutout wood railings framed by peeled log posts, all varnished a dark brown. Southwestern pattern carpets are accented with Arts and Crafts Movement furnishings and native southwestern motifs. There are two gift stores at the left and right, and numerous mounted moose, deer, and elk heads ring the room high on the walls under exposed log timbers. Accessible restrooms are located down a hallway to the right of the check-in desk in the center of the rotunda. Keys to these facilities may be requested at the desk.To the rear of the lobby is a dining room with large windows through which one can view the canyon.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 19, North Rim Visitor Center. 5 minutes. The North Rim Visitor Center is located about 400 feet (120 meters) north of Grand Canyon Lodge along the east side of the road, at the far south end of the main lodge parking lot. Note there are two sections of several wheelchair accessible parking spaces along the bottom of this lot. This stop begins behind the Visitor Center. From a position facing south from the south end of the parking lot, straight ahead, a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) square concrete plaza fills the area in back of the Visitor Center building, off to the right. About 15 feet (four and a half meters) ahead at the left stands a 10 foot (three meter) tall stone wayside structure with open sides and a triangular log and shingle roof. About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the stone structure at the left, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. At the top center, a central L C D screen allows one to select from one of four vehicle pass options. A note to the left of the screen lists a telephone number for assistance purchasing a pass: 9 2 8, 6 3 8, 7 8 5 0. Inside the stone structure, several large information panels about the park\u2019s trails and overlooks are displayed, including several maps of the region. A description of these panels is included in the sub-script below. About six feet (two meters) to the right of the far end of the wayside structure, note a water bottle filling station atop a low, rectangular stone base with three spigots across its face. To the right of the water station, two 12-foot (three and a half meter) tall square, stone pillars support the back log and shingle roof of the Visitor Center. They frame a wide walkway to a set of restrooms inside through a pair of double, wood and glass doors. Note the men\u2019s restroom is to the left, and the women\u2019s accessible restroom is to the right. Also note a wooden bench along the walkway to the right, and a single wooden chair to the left. Embedded in the middle of the plaza, between the wayside structure and Visitor Center building, a compass rose surrounds a central brass medallion with the words, \u201cGrand Canyon National Park North Rim\u201d around its edge in all capital letters. The center of the medallion lists several statistics. It reads: Elevation above sea: 8,238 feet (2,511 meters) D M S (N A D 83): 36 degrees, 11 minutes, 54 seconds North; 112 degrees, three minutes, eight seconds West U T M (N A D 83 Zone 12 N): 4 0 5 3 9 2 E, 4 0 0 6 4 6 8 N At the far northeast end of the plaza, a small, standalone, wood plank hut with an open front houses a coin-operated soda machine at the left, and an ice machine along the back wall. To move to the Visitor Center entrance, once again from a position located at the south end of the main parking lot, turn right (east) toward the lodge loop road, and move forward about 35 feet (10 meters) down a slightly sloping sidewalk along the side of the building. Note a pair of metal, wildlife-proof garbage cans to the right back towards the lot. Just past a couple, two-tier wooden benches at the right, the sidewalk narrows, bounded by low stone boulders at the right. A few more feet forward, the sidewalk turns left to face up an inclined ramp with a log fence and railing on either side. Continue about 20 feet (six meters) up the ramp to a 15 foot wide by 10 foot deep (four and a half by three meter) wood plank porch at the front of the Visitor Center. You may enter the Visitor Center through a pair of wood and glass doors in the center of the porch at the left. On the porch to the left and right of the front doors, two, three-foot tall, angled, wooden wayside panels display information about North Rim Park Ranger programs and park announcements. Note there is a wooden bench on the far side of the porch opposite the ramp. Also note across the porch, directly opposite the front doors, a wide flight of 10 concrete stairs with a log railing on either side lead down to a sidewalk in front the Visitor Center, beside the two-lane lodge loop road. The Visitor Center houses the Grand Canyon Conservancy bookstore. It features a wide variety of books, maps, and gifts to help you plan or remember your trip to Grand Canyon, and to learn more about its geology, ecology, and history. Sub-Script Welcome Wayside Panel About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the tall stone wayside structure, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. Behind the pay station, words at the top of an information panel mounted to the face of the stone wayside structure read, \u201cWelcome to Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim.\u201d A color photograph filling the bottom half of the panel shows a view of a Grand Canyon sunset at Bright Angel Point. At the center left of the panel, the first of two inset color images shows a photograph of the front porch of the Visitor Center. A list of the amenities and their icons below the photograph reads: Information and Orientation; Water; Restrooms; and Access to Grand Canyon rim and lodge. The second image at the center right shows a map of the roads around the North Rim, traced in black. The roads generally run along the top of the map, from the lodge and campground areas at the left, up and across the Kaibab and Walhalla Plateaus to the right to Point Imperial, Vista Encantada, Roosevelt Point, all the way to Cape Royal at the lower right. At the left of the image, a small, rectangular \u201cYou Are Here\u201d label sits below another label identifying the Visitor Center. Exploring the Region Wayside Panel On the inside face of the short, north, front stone wall of the wayside structure, an information panel presents a half dozen color photographs at the top and bottom of other, nearby national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. In the center of the panel is a map identifying their locations relative to Grand Canyon National Park, shown in the center of the map. From left to right at the top, there is an image of a conical, thatched hut from Pipe Spring National Monument in Arizona, the high, vertical cliff walls of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, and the dam and river below the high, curved stone walls of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona and Utah. From left to right at the bottom, there is an image of tall, stone buttresses with flat, stone tops at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, three isolated, tall stone buttes in Monument Valley Tribal Park in Arizona and Utah, and the rim of the steep, deep canyon at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. Many other sites are also shown on the map. Explore Close By Wayside Panel Sheltered in the center of the stone wayside structure, two five-foot wide by three-foot tall (one and a half by one meter) information panels mounted on angled, metal reading rails stand back-to-back. From a position facing east, with the short, north stone wall and the \u201cExploring the Region\u201d wayside at the left, a color photograph at the top left of this panel shows a canyon view along Bright Angel Trail, framed by a rocky overhang above, and a couple scraggly evergreens at the left. Text beneath the photograph reads: Explore Close By Experience the North Rim: walks along the rim, down into the canyon, and through high forests. Feel the remoteness of this high vantage point. These hikes are only a short walk of drive away. For information about more hikes, drives, and overlooks \u2013 see the other side. At the bottom left, a caption below an inset image of a small newspaper reads: The park newspaper, The Guide, contains detailed information about hikes. Available at the visitor center in Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Francais, Italiano, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. A map of the immediate North Rim area fills the middle of the panel. A dark line traces the outline of the rim, a long, slender, peninsula-like shape, like Italy without the heel of the boot. At the lower left, a legend above a compass rose shows the symbols used for the roads, sidewalks, trails, and buildings on the map. Towards the bottom center, in a cluster of buildings around Grand Canyon Lodge, a couple small, rectangular labels point to the Visitor Center with the words, \u201cYou Are Here.\u201d In the center of the map is the campground, with the North Kaibab trailhead near the top. Small, numbered circles appear along four of the dotted line trails, corresponding to a photograph and short description of each trail on the right side of the panel. At the top right of the panel, the first of three descriptions shows a photograph of the canyon along the Bright Angel fault. A title reads: 1 \u2013 Bright Angel Point Trail \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Walk the short trail from the lodge to a dramatic canyon overlook. Zero point five miles (zero point eight kilometers) roundtrip 30 minute roundtrip The second of three descriptions shows a photograph of a packed dirt path winding through a stand of tall ponderosa pine. A title reads: 2 \u2013 Bridle Path \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Hike through ponderosa forests to the North Kaibab Trailhead. Two point four miles (three point nine kilometers) roundtrip. One point five hours roundtrip. Bicycles and leashed pets allowed. The third descriptions shows a photograph of a wide dirt and gravel path lined with large boulders beside a mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. A title reads: 3 \u2013 Transept Trail \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Explore the rim between the lodge and the North Rim Campground. Three miles (four point eight kilometers) roundtrip. One point five hours roundtrip. The fourth description fills the bottom right of the panel. A photograph shows a wooded area at the base of high, rock walls. A title reads: 4 \u2013 North Kaibab Trail \u2013 Moderate to Difficult A caption continues:",

      "audioDescription": "The Grand Canyon Visitor Center shuttle bus terminal is located on the southeast side of Grand Canyon Visitor Center Plaza in a large, open-air gazebo filled with many benches. A large analog clock with no hands hangs in the middle of the gazebo, with overhead signs pointing to the Bookstore, Canyon Rim, and the shuttle bus stops themselves. The bus stops and bus turnarounds are located to the east outside the gazebo across a one-lane asphalt road. Be mindful of bus traffic as you move to this area. Free shuttle buses operate on four routes at Grand Canyon National Park: Hermits Rest Route (indicated in red on the map), Village Route (blue), Kaibab/Rim Route (orange), and Tusayan [TWO-see-ahn] Route (purple). The shuttles are free, no tickets are required, and bus stops are clearly marked here at the terminal and throughout the park by signs along with their matching color. Buses are white with a green stripe. The route name is indicated on the front of the bus. Note that the Hermits Rest Route is not in service between December 1 and February 28. During those three months only, Hermit Road is open to private vehicles. Note also that the Tusayan Route operates during summer only. Exact dates are announced each winter prior to the shuttle's operation. A scenic drive accessibility permit is available at all entrance stations, visitor centers, hotels, and the Backcountry Information Center. The permit allows access to some areas closed to the general-public traffic. Shuttle buses are equipped with ramps to accommodate wheelchairs smaller than 30 inches wide by 48 inches long (76 by 122 cm). Most motorized scooters will not fit on shuttle buses. Note that food, drinks, and pets are not permitted on shuttle buses, but service animals for visitors with disabilities are allowed.",

It replaced a structure in another location that had burned in 1933. Over the years, the Community Building has hosted plays, dances, and community meetings; housed a public library; offered movies; served as the Masonic lodge meeting room; and provided space for a day care center and classrooms.<br /> <br /> The rock monument in front of the Community Building memorializes Del E. Webb, a Phoenix-based contractor and philanthropist whose construction company built and renovated several buildings in Grand Canyon National Park. After his death in 1974, the Del E. Webb Foundation continued to support the park through funding various renovations. Grand Canyon is appreciative of the support of the Del E. Webb Foundation over the years.<br /> <br /> In 1996 the Community Building underwent a substantial rehabilitation.</p>",

Shaped and built like a Hopi pueblo, Hopi House was originally designed to house the main sales rooms for Fred Harvey Indian Arts. Mary Colter designed the building to resemble a Hopi dwelling similar to those at Oraibi, Arizona. In its early years, Hopi House was an actual dwelling-some of the Hopis who worked in the building lived on the upper floors.<br /> <br /> Hopi House is rectangular and its multiple roofs are stepped at various levels, giving the impression of Puebloan architecture. The sandstone walls are reddish in color, and tiny windows, like those of true Hopi structures, allow only the smallest amount of light into the building.<br /> <br /> Inside, the floor finish on the first story is concrete. Most of the rooms have a ceiling typical of the Hopi style: saplings, grasses, and twigs with a mud coating on top, resting on peeled log beams. Corner fireplaces, small niches in the walls, and a mud-plaster wall finish, typical of Hopi interiors, are also character-defining features.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located opposite the El Tovar hotel on the other side of the large circular driveway, Hopi House is a three-story stepped stone masonry structure with sandstone walls with parapets. Mary Colter designed Hopi House to blend into the neighboring environment, using local natural materials such as sandstone and juniper modeled after Hopi pueblo dwellings. The flat roof surfaces function as terraces. Small openings with wood sash windows and low ceilings minimize the harsh desert sunlight. Chimneys are made from broken pottery jars stacked and mortared together. An old staircase leading to the second floor is decorated with murals by an unknown Hopi artist. Inside, the interior limestone walls are plastered with adobe, and the ceilings are composed of saplings, twigs and grass covered with mud. An 18-inch (46 cm) square metal plaque mounted flat to the top of a four-foot (1.2 m) tall rectangular limestone pedestal, located about 50 feet (15 m) west of Hopi House off Village Loop Drive, reads: Hopi House has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America, 1987, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior. At the west entrance to Hopi House, a low wooden door opens onto gently declining wood floors. Inside, the walls are lined with display cases filled with various native arts and crafts available for purchase, alongside tables and racks of clothing and Navajo rugs. Move 18 steps up an interior staircase to a small gallery on the second floor. The second floor also houses a shrine, called a kiva, with replicas of Hopi religious artifacts.",

Hopi House opened to the public in 1905. In an era when most architects were men, it was Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter's first building. The 36-year-old Colter enlisted the help of local Hopi craftsmen to build Hopi House, using locally quarried stone and wood harvested from the nearby forest. Hopi House was not just a curio store, it was also a place from where American Indian artisans lived and worked. Under the watchful eyes of visitors, these artisans would create beautiful jewelry, pottery, blankets, and other items that would then be sold at Hopi House, forging a personal connection to the items visitors purchased there.\" A quote at the top from Virginia Grattan's 1992 book, \"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth,\" reads: \"For Mary Colter, Hopi House was an opportunity to re-create the distinctive dwelling of an ancient culture and to acquaint the public with the richness and beauty of Native American art.\" The first of two inset black-and-white photographs at the bottom right shows a Hopi village filled with similar stone buildings and terraces with the caption: \"Colter modeled Hopi House after centuries-old villages on the Hopi Reservation.\" At the bottom right, a second photograph shows a half-dozen men and women with their wares seated on an elaborate rug in front of Hopi House with the caption: \"Hopi artisans and their families, in exchange for their artwork and demonstrations, received wages and lodging at Hopi House. Today, various tribes demonstrate traditional dance and art, but they are no longer housed here.\" On the right panel, an old black-and-white photograph shows about 15 well-dressed visitors standing on the El Tovar veranda with a black convertible motorcar parked out front. Text at the top left reads: \"El Tovar Hotel. The El Tovar Hotel was a game changer. Prior to its construction most Grand Canyon visitors slept in tent accommodations on the South Rim. Opening to great fanfare on January 14, 1905, the hotel catered to a wealthy clientele. Imagine guests' delight upon finding a music room, a solarium, a billiard hall, an underground grotto (where men enjoyed a friendly game of cards), a barbershop, two roof gardens, an art room, and gift shop. For $4.50 and upwards per night, guests were treated to finely decorated rooms with both hot and cold running water.\" Text to the right of the photograph reads: \"Keeping with the Santa Fe Railway's affinity for naming their hotels after Spanish explorers, \"El Tovar\" honored Don Pedro de Tovar, who visited the Hopi mesas to the east in 1540.\" A quote from the Coconino Sun from May 24, 1902 at the top right reads: \"The Santa Fe is going to build the most expensive hotel...at the Grand Canyon...the idea of the architect is to bring the building into harmony with the wonderful scenery of the canyon rather than to put a blot upon its beauty by the erection of a conventional structure.\" A second black-and-white photograph inset at the bottom right shows the interior of one of the rooms with two wooden sleigh beds, a couple rocking chairs, a large dresser topped with a mirror, and a smaller vanity. A caption reads: \"Early 20th century visitors enjoyed the comforts and luxuries of the El Tovar.\"",

By October 1902, he had persuaded his brother Emery to join him. A year later, the brothers established their photography business near Bright Angel Trailhead after receiving permission from Ralph Cameron, who at the time owned Bright Angel Trail. They camped out in a small tent on the canyon rim before building a small wooden house in 1906, which they called Kolb Studio.<br /> <br /> Over the next 12 years, the Kolb brothers established themselves as both photographers and adventurers. From capturing unorthodox photos of hard-to-reach areas of the canyon to documenting their 101 days running the Colorado River on film with a motion-picture camera, Ellsworth and Emery revealed images that few had dreamed of. Selling their images in leather-bound books for three dollars each and touring the country to present their film lecture series, the Kolb brothers made a name for themselves and opened the eyes of a nation to this wonder of the world.<br /> <br /> For decades, the Kolb brothers continued to make a living out of Kolb Studio on Grand Canyon's South Rim. Later in life, when their contractual agreements with the park ended, the National Park Service actually wanted to demolish this studio in the 1960s. The architecture wasn't quite in line with the style and theme of other buildings in the park. After several years of quibbling between Emery and the agency, the structure was saved when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, legislation that effectively protected park structures over 50 years old from being destroyed.</p> <h3>Tour the Private Residence</h3> <p><strong>Enter the little seen depths of this\u00a0five-story building for a\u00a0behind the scenes tour of the Kolb family's\u00a0private home and photography studio.\u00a0</strong></p> <ul> <li>Your guide\u00a0will weave\u00a0stories of the Kolb\u00a0family members.<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><strong>Days Offered:</strong> Tuesday,\u00a0Wednesday and Friday</li> <li><strong>Time</strong>: 1 pm\u00a0| 60 minutes (one hour)\u00a0</li> <li> <p><strong>Participant\u00a0Size:</strong>\u00a08</p> </li> <li><strong>Meet Location</strong>:\u00a0Gallery downstairs\u00a0(access is through the store).<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/experience-grand-canyon/guided-tours/kolb-studio-tour\">Additional\u00a0information about the tour</a>\u00a0\u00a0</li> <li><strong>Price:</strong>\u00a0$30/person\u00a0| <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/reservations?%2Freserve%2Ftt3-kolb-studio\">Register online</a></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "<h4><span>Hours of Operation</span></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>CLOSED for refurbishment (will reopen February 2026)</strong></span></p> <p><br /> Designed in 1914, Lookout Studio was architect Mary\u00a0Colter's vision to create opportunities for visitors to safely view and photograph the natural beauty of Grand Canyon from its edge. Just west of El Tovar Hotel, \"The Lookout\" is a neat, comfortable, and rustic studio of stone and log timbers. For many years, Lookout Studio served as a community gathering place, where locals and visitors alike would sit around the fire, swap stories, and use telescopes to watch mule riders on the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> Today it serves as a gift and souvenir shop and viewpoint, with several terraces that allow visitors to absorb the power and scale of the canyon from uniquely safe perspectives.</p> <h4>History and Architecture</h4> <p>This native stone structure, originally known as \"the Lookout,\" is built right into the canyon rim and appears to almost be growing organically from\u00a0it. Generally rectangular in plan, the small building is constructed of coursed rubble masonry.<br /> <br /> Commissioned to directly compete with the Kolb brothers and Kolb Studio, Mary Colter designed Lookout Studio in a similar manner as Hopi House: to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. Inspired by the natural forms of the landscape around the site, she used these influences to guide her design.<br /> <br /> The parapet rooflines and stone chimneys mimic the irregular shapes of surrounding bedrock. The interior of the building is divided into several levels, with structural log work exposed in posts, beams, and ceiling joists. The floor is scored concrete and the interior walls are exposed stone. Because of all of the viewing windows around the walls of the structure (which naturally feature Colter's trademark baby blue window frames), the interior is considerably lighter than most of Colter's other buildings.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "This two-story stone building, approximately 40- by 50-feet (12- by 15-meters) square, is perched on the edge of Grand Canyon. Through its use of local stone and wood, the building emulates the natural scenery along the rim and appears to rise from the rock around it. The walls in front rise to an irregular stone parapet, incorporating the building's chimneys. Inside, a main level houses a gift shop selling photographic prints, rock specimens, and books under a low pitch shed roof with log rafters. With its banks of large windows, Lookout Studio affords outstanding views from all floors and receives a great deal of light. The Bright Angel Trail can be seen from here. Condors often soar up and down the cliffs in the summer, using the warmed afternoon winds to cruise along the canyon. A wooden staircase at the back left of the shop leads up nine steps to a three-foot (1 m) wide landing through a wood and glass door onto an open wooden balcony. A second set of stairs at the right leads down seven steps across a six-foot (2 m) square landing through a wood and glass door onto an open outdoor stone terrace. High-powered telescopes are available at both viewing areas. Two additional outdoor observation areas sit below this first terrace. Facing back toward the door, these are accessed via a narrow stone staircase at the back left of the terrace. With the metal railing on your left, move down nine steps to a small landing and turn left. Follow along the metal railing on your right and turn left down 12 steps to an uneven rocky platform, five-feet (1.5 m) wide by 20-feet (6 m) long. Following the right-hand wall, move forward about eight feet (2.4 m) to another stone staircase, and move down nine steps to the lowest terrace. As you follow along the three-foot (1 m) high rock wall on your right, mind your footing on the rocky, uneven, four-foot (1.2 m) wide path. The canyon drops off immediately on the other side of the wall.",

However, the\u00a0wheelchair accessible, Mather Point overlook\u00a0is a short walk further east (to the right (from the bus stop) when facing the canyon). The viewing area at Mather Point is quite extensive with two major overlooks, each lined with four-foot (1.2 m) high metal safety railings built into the rocks that project out into the canyon. A plaque honoring Stephen Mather sits at the top right of a 20-foot (6 m) wide set of concrete stairs that lead down to the main overlook area. Note there is also a ramp down to the overlook located about 140 feet (42 m) west of the stairs. Following along the right handrail, move down 6 steps to a concrete landing. Continue eight feet (2.4 m) forward, moving to the right of a central limestone boulder in the center of the path to your left. Move eight steps down to a second landing, and continue 15 feet (4.5 m) forward to a central staircase. Move down 10 more steps to a third landing, and continue 20 feet (6 m) along the right-hand railing to a final set of steps. Move down seven steps to the landing at the point itself past a low, rocky platform to your left. Move all around the point, following along the railing. The powerful Colorado River snakes far below at the bottom of a one mile (1600 m) deep abyss. Colorful rock layers fill the cliffs all around you, including the tan Kaibab Formation, white and creamy Coconino Sandstone, red to orange Hermit Shale and Supai Formation, and dark gray to black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom. The panorama at Mather Point spans from Bright Angel Trail in the west to the South Kaibab Trail in the east. In between is the deep canyon of Pipe Creek, Cedar Ridge, and O'Neill Butte. The Tonto Trail is also visible. The North Rim stands 10 miles (16 km) away across the chasm. Back up on the rim, the railing continues in both directions from the point offering various other viewpoints. To the west, the Rim Trail offers more vistas all the way to Yavapai Point.",

Located just off the\u00a0connector trail\u00a0between the Canyon Rim Trail and Park Headquarters, McKee features bench seating in an open-air amphitheater.

Hired to work at Grand Canyon in 1929 Eddie McKee established ranger led programs\u00a0along the canyon rims, installed interpretive signs and displays, wrote educational pamphlets, and helped to establish the first version of Grand Canyon's research library and the non-profit that continues\u00a0to\u00a0support park operations to this day.\u00a0Trained as a geologist he authored numerous scientific papers on Grand Canyon rocks and strata as well as the canyon's natural resources. Working at the canyon until 1940 Eddie McKee helped to lay the frame work for modern Interpretation of Grand Canyon resources and greatly expanded the collective\u00a0knowledge of both the ancient environments and conditions that formed Grand Canyon's rock layers as well as the forces and processes necessary to carve the vast canyon we see today.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

At the front right of the amphitheater is a six-foot (2 m) diameter firepit just off of the stage, surrounded by a low, 15-inch (38 cm) tall limestone ring. McKee Amphitheater is used for educational and evening programs at Grand Canyon National Park during the warmer summer months and can accommodate approximately 500 people.",

      "bodyText": "<p>This viewpoint is named for Thomas Moran, an artist well known for his landscape paintings of the western United States. His work helped to create many national parks. Explore this point for a good spot to watch the shadows and changing light throughout the day, just as the artist did.</p> <h3>Thomas Moran</h3> <p>In 1873, Hudson River School artist Thomas Moran joined John Wesley Powell on his exploratory expeditions of Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau. Shortly after his return, Moran set to work on a canvas equal in size and ambition to his earlier 1872 painting from Yellowstone National Park, \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\". In 1874, Congress purchased the result, \"The Chasm of the Colorado\" (1873-1874, National Museum of American Art) for $10,000. It became the second of Moran's western landscapes to hang in the United States Capitol, and is now part of the Smithsonian Institution, residing primarily at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p> <h3>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h3> <p>Geology is a prominent feature at any Grand Canyon viewpoint, but especially so at Moran Point. From here, all three main rock groups of Grand Canyon are clearly visible.<br /> <br /> The horizontal sedimentary layers of rock that make up the majority of what we see in Grand Canyon's depths are known as the Layered Paleozoic Rocks. Beneath these relatively flat-lying layers are the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, which represent a significant portion of the canyon's geologic record even though they are only exposed in a few isolated sections of the canyon. These tilted layers are only visible from a few select viewpoints along the rim, including here at Moran Point. The black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite, as well as a few other associated metamorphic and igneous rocks are collectively known as the Vishnu basement rocks. These are the oldest rocks in the canyon, and thus are found far below near the Colorado River, beneath the over-lying sedimentary layers.<br /> <br /> The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> From Moran Point, one can observe prominent tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup directly to the north, sitting on the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks to the west. The short segment of the Colorado River visible here is cutting through a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, with tall cliffs of brown Shinumo Sandstone above. These vibrant orange layers of rock can also be seen on this side of the river, directly below the viewpoint to the northwest. Beyond these layers, on the far side of the canyon, one can observe four distinct layers of rock sitting on the Vishnu basement rocks. In order, these are a sill of black Cardenas Basalt, purple layers of Bass Formation, a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, and brown cliffs of Shinumo Sandstone.</p>",

A few hundred feet (120 meters) north of the entrance station along the west side of the road, massive, eight foot (nearly three meter) tall, thick, round posts rise from a mound of large boulders; a third, horizontal wooden post spans the distance between them. A six foot wide by four foot tall (two by one and a half meter) wooden sign hangs suspended from wide, black metal bands wrapped around the top post. White carved lettering on the sign reads: \u201cEntering Grand Canyon National Park, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.\u201d A three-foot (one meter) tall National Park Service arrowhead logo emblazons the front of a wooden post to the right of the sign. About 10 feet (three meters) in front of the sign, lettering on a metal plaque embedded in a large boulder on the ground announces Grand Canyon National Park is a World Heritage Site. The park is open daily, from May 15th to October 15th. If you arrive when park rangers are not at the entrance station, and you are not a pass holder, please proceed to the automated fee station next to the North Rim Visitor Center. From November 1st to December 1st, the North Rim is open for \"dawn to dusk\" day use with limited services. However, if snow closes Highway 67 before December 1, the park will also close. Though road closures prevent vehicles from driving to the North Rim during the winter season, hikers, snowshoers, and cross country skiers may enter the North Rim of the park through the winter months, provided backcountry permits have been obtained. Personal snowmobiles are NOT permitted inside the park. The North Rim reopens on May 15 of every year.",

Two large diameter, eight-foot (two and a half meter) tall log posts support the porch roof in front at the left and right. A log railing runs along the front of both sides of the eight-foot deep porch. Note a number of small tables and chairs on the porch behind the railing at the left and right.

Here you\u2019ll find a wide variety of groceries and gifts, first aid supplies, as well as camping gear and water filtration equipment. The checkout counter is located along the left-hand wall. Back outside the store, the sidewalk continues south along the side of the building to the women\u2019s restroom, then continues south to the men\u2019s restroom beyond. Note a small picnic area to the east of the Grocery Store, with several tables set under a high canopy of ponderosa pine.",

Turn left onto Campground Road, and continue about one-tenth of a mile (160 meters) along the paved, two-lane asphalt road to the pull-off at the right to the Sinclair service station. On the left side of the pullout is a single, modern gas-pump island with a single width lane on either side. To the right, a bicycle rack blocks the entrance to a vestigial gas-pump island, under a simple, flat overhang. Continuing to the right is the entrance to the office of a low, one-story brown building with several large, plate glass windows and a full-length wood and glass door. Inside there is a small wooden desk and a set of shelves along the wall behind it filled with several different brands of motor oil and other automotive fluids. Note that while there are two vehicle bays to the right of the office with large, rolling doors, no automobile repair or maintenance services are offered here. A picnic table stands in front of one of the bays. Outside, to the left of the office, is a wheelchair accessible Men\u2019s room, and around a small stand of trees to the left is a similarly accessible Women\u2019s room. These facilities are often closed, however, replaced by two portable toilets placed about 20 feet (six meters) to the left of the Women\u2019s room along the far curb of the station.\u2003",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 7, Point Imperial. 4 \u00bc minutes. The road to Point Imperial leads north from the \u2018Y\u2019 nearly three miles (four and a half kilometers) to a one-way loop road at the point itself. At the far end of the loop road, to the right, a row of parallel car parking spaces faces a six-foot wide asphalt sidewalk. Larger recreational vehicles may parallel park at the left alongside a second sidewalk, beside a grove of trees with several picnic tables. Note there are vault toilets located at the far northern end of the picnic area. A wide concrete walkway leads to two pairs of gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible vault toilets at the left and right. Just beyond the open doorways to the toilets, note also there is a wildlife-proof garbage can, flanked by two recycling cans for plastic, glass, and aluminum. About two-thirds of the way around the parking lot loop to the right, opposite two wheelchair accessible parking spaces, a six-foot (two meter) wide asphalt path lined with small boulders leads east down a slight incline from the lot towards the point. At the head of the path to the left, a five-foot (one and a half meter) tall wooden sign stands before a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) wide dirt and gravel area under a stand of tall Ponderosa pine. Block capital letters read, \u201cPOINT IMPERIAL, ELV 8803\u201d (2684 meters). About 30 feet straight ahead from the elevation sign, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim to the east. Entitled, \u201cMissing Layers,\u201d it discusses why no dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. To the left of the wayside panel, a wooden bench overlooks the rim. Note there are no guardrails between the bench and rim. To the left of the bench, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim. Entitled \u201cGrand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint,\u201d it discusses the very different view of the rock layers here. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. About 30 feet to the right of the elevation sign, note a second wooden bench in an open, dirt and gravel area behind a low, half-log wooden bench closer to the rim. Note there are no guardrails here, either. Continuing down the wheelchair accessible asphalt path towards the point, it first curves slightly left, then turns sharply back right down a slightly steeper incline along the rim\u2019s edge to a flight of concrete stairs with metal handrails on either side. Eleven stairs lead halfway down to a concrete landing, followed by eleven more stairs to a concrete landing at the bottom of the staircase. Continuing forward from the landing, move onto the rough, rocky terrain of the roughly 30 foot long by 10 foot wide (nine by three meter) lookout area at Point Imperial. Note the entire area is surrounded by four-foot tall metal railings. From here at the most northern boundary of the park, visitors take in panoramic views of the Painted Desert and the eastern end of Grand Canyon and Vermilion Cliffs beyond. The canyon transforms from the narrow walls of Marble Canyon to a more open and dramatic \"grand\" canyon. Layers of red and black Precambrian rocks add contrast and color. Note at the far northern end of the parking lot, a wooden sign to the right of a dirt and gravel trail identifies the Point Imperial trail (5.4 miles roundtrip; 8.7 kilometers) that ends at the north park boundary. A second, smaller wooden sign shows the distances to the Saddle Mountain Trail (2.2 miles, 3.5 kilometers), and the Nankoweap Trail (5.2 miles, 8.4 kilometers). Note also at the far southern end of the lot, a 15-foot (five meter) wide, stone staircase leads down one step to a stone landing, then down three more stone steps to a dirt and gravel area and the beginning of the unpaved Ken Patrick Trail in a grove of trees. The 9.8 mile (15.8 kilometer) trail winds through the forest and along the rim to the North Kaibab Trail parking area. Sub-Script Missing Layers Wayside Panel A panoramic color vista of the canyon from Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. The Vermillion and Echo Cliffs are just visible far off in the distance, with the tall Kaibab limestone cliffs close in the foreground. Entitled \u201cMissing Layers,\u201d words at the top left read: In the distant view you can see the Mesozoic rocks of the Vermilion and Echo cliffs, where the nearest dinosaur fossils are found. No dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon, but that does not mean dinosaurs never roamed here. Mesozoic rock layers\u2014a mile (1.6 km) thick\u2014once covered the canyon\u2019s Kaibab Limestone layer, the rock where you are standing. When the Kaibab Plateau rose up 70\u201340 million years ago, the soft overlaying Mesozoic rock cracked, broke, and eroded away. Like hosing mud from a cement driveway, the Mesozoic rock vanished from the hard-surfaced Kaibab Limestone, washing away all evidence of dinosaurs. At the top right, additional red cliffs shown in two small inset color photographs are identified as Zion and Glen Canyon. A caption above reads: North of the Vermilion Cliffs in Utah are Zion, Capitol Reef, Glen Canyon, and Arches national park sites, all carved from Mesozoic rocks. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of a young boy facing us with his arms outstretched to the sides. Entitled, \u201cArms Span Time,\u201d words next to a short, vertical white line by his fingertips at the left read, \u201cEarth Forms.\u201d Moving right, words next to a short, vertical white line by his right shoulder read, \u201cOldest Grand Canyon rocks.\u201d By his thumb at the right, \u201cYoungest Grand Canyon rocks.\u201d At the base of his fingers, \u201cAge of dinosaurs.\u201d And finally by his fingertips at the far right, \u201cGrand Canyon carved,\u201d and \u201cToday.\u201d Grand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint Wayside Panel A panoramic, labeled color vista of the canyon from this spot at Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. At the left there is the Marble Platform, Nankoweap Mesa, and the Colorado River (hidden), with the Supergroup rocks in the left foreground. The Desert Fa\u00e7ade appears at the center left, and the much closer, pyramid-shaped Mt. Hayden at the right. Text at the top reads: As you look east from Point Imperial\u2019s vista, you command the highest viewpoint in the park, at 8,803 feet (2,684 m). The view is very different here. There is no visible basement rock in the rock layers\u2014the river has not cut that deeply yet. Prominent in the middle view are the Supergroup rocks, the middle rock layers of the canyon, often absent or obscured. The distant Marble Platform is a 2,700 foot (820 m) step down from Point Imperial. Though not visible in the view, as the raven flies, you are nearly seven miles (11 km) removed from the Colorado River. The river meanders its course more than a mile (1.6 km) below this elevation. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of the Washington Monument and Reflecting Pool. Text reads: Highest Vista, Biggest Drop You are at the highest viewpoint looking at the deepest view. Directly east is Nankoweap Mesa\u2014the mesa topped with Limestone west of the Desert Facade. Behind this mesa is the river, some 6,000 feet (1,830 m) below us here \u2013 translated in Washington Monuments: that is 10 of them stacked end to end.",

      "audioDescription": "Two openings in the low 2-foot (60 cm) high limestone wall lead north away from the sidewalk at the shuttle bus stop, two, 6-foot (2 m) wide asphalt-paved paths are lined with low, irregular stones. One path leads down a set of three stone steps. The more western path leads to a wheelchair accessible ramp. The two paths converge about 30 feet (9 m) along. Move 200 feet (60 m) forward on the path along the narrow point to a 12-foot (3.5 m) tall by 20-foot (6 m) wide limestone memorial\u2014a Mayan-style truncated pyramid with a central staircase. Nearby, a photograph at the top right of a 3-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel, shows a bearded man in the canyon, next to an etching depicting long wooden boats running the rapids. Text on the panel reads: \"Early Explorer This monument honors Major John Wesley Powell, the leader of the first documented expedition through Grand Canyon. Imagine entering the depths of Grand Canyon down a roaring, not-yet-charted river, not knowing whether you will emerge. Because Powell's first expedition in 1869 was more survival than science, he led a second in 1871-1872, which gave America its first geologic glimpse of the canyon. Powell's crew prepares to shove off at Green River, Wyoming on their 1871-1872 expedition.\" Two 3-foot (1 m) wide by 3-foot (1 m) tall stone railings line either side of the central 8-foot (2.4 m) wide, 15-step stone staircase of the monument, leading up to a 10x12-foot (3x4-meter) platform. Text below an image of a man with thinning hair and a long, bushy beard, cast into the center of a 6-foot (2 m) wide by 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal plaque at the back of the landing, reads: \"Erected by the Congress of the United States to Major John Wesley Powell first explorer of the Grand Canyon who descended the river with his party in row boats traversing the gorge beneath this point August 17, 1869 and again September 1, 1872.\" Two circular metal plaques on the left face of the monument commemorate the 50th and 75th anniversaries of Grand Canyon National Park. A similar plaque on the right face commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Powell expedition in 1969. A portrait of a young, bearded man fills the center. The asphalt path continues around both sides of the monument and converges 30 feet (9 m) behind the structure. Two wooden benches sit to the left of each path, at the back of a 20-foot (6 m) wide open viewing area located on the point itself. Note there are no railings here, the viewing platform being ringed only by a series of large stones.",

Text at the top right reads: \"Revealing Features Mary Colter's attention to detail is reflected in every element of the Desert View Watchtower. Each rock and painted wall was intended to convey meaning. Colter used ornamental details, seeming haphazardly, to create an added charm of the unexpected. Find triangular and diamond patterned rocks, horizontal bands of different sizes, and actual petroglyphs with pecked designs. The tower features T-shaped doors and tapered windows like buildings hundreds of years old. Colter used uneven masonry surfaces to \"create shadow and give more vigor to the walls.\" At the bottom left of the panel, text continues: \"Stories Preserved in Stone Many ideas from Colter's research trips emerge in this architectural masterpiece. Climb the 85 steps and allow the artists' and masons' details to reveal themselves.\" The first of 4 black-and-white photographs to the right shows a man wearing jeans, a long-sleeve white shirt, and a headband standing next to a T-shaped stone door from Chaco Culture National Historical Park, followed by a close-up of diamond-patterned rocks from the same location. The next picture of petroglyphs from the Painted Desert shows various animal and human figures and a sun spirit. The last photograph shows a couple perpendicular stone walls with intermingled rows of roughly rectangular- and triangular-shaped stones\u2014examples of ornamental masonry from Wupatki National Monument.",

Please respect the use of the site for those who have gone through the reservation and permitting process. If the gate blocking the use of the road/trail is open or unlocked, please reconsider visiting the site.<br /> <br /> For those not reserving this area for an event, it is a short 2-mile round trip hike that follows a\u00a0dirt road out to the rim of the Grand Canyon for views toward the Desert View Watchtower and across the canyon to the North Rim.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>In spring the road tends to be very muddy as the snow thaws on the canyon rim. Please stick to the road and be prepared for the conditions of the season.\u00a0</p> <h3>Group Events</h3> <p>The park offers this area for groups wishing to host a wedding, celebrate a birthday, conduct a memorial service, hold a family reunion, or a similar event. The site features a covered pavilion, picnic tables, grills, trash cans, and a vault toilet. There is no water or electricity. An unimproved dirt road leads to this isolated area.<br /> <br /> You may obtain a permit for a reservation no earlier than one year prior to the requested date on a first come, first-served basis. To obtain a permit, visit: http://www.nps.gov/grca/parkmgmt/sup.htm.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>Shoshone Point is named after the Shoshone tribe, a North American Indian group that occupied a territory that is now southeastern California, across central and eastern Nevada and northwestern Utah into southern Idaho and western Wyoming. Today, the Shoshone still live on reservations throughout the west in the states or Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A little over a mile (1.6 km) east of Yaki Point Road, an unsigned turn-off on the north side of Desert View Drive leads to a small parking lot in the forest. A locked gate at the north end of the lot limits access to an unpaved, single lane road that leads one mile (1.6 km) through the forest to Shoshone Point. Smell the air. A prescribed fire once burned here. The flames licked and blackened the trunks and branches of the ponderosa pine trees of this forest, completely engulfing some, and felling others. New grasses and pine saplings sprout up through the bed of pine needles covering the ground. Touch the five to nine inch (12 to 23 cm) long needles, bound together in bundles of three. Notice the different color bark of the trees. Young trees have rough black bark, while older trees have deep orange-brown bark. About 50 feet (15 m) back from the road and 25 feet (8 m) west of the parking lot stands an 80-foot (24 m) tall double-trunk ponderosa pine tree with a blackened trunk. Move to this tree, being mindful of the uneven ground and shallow trench cut into the soil. Touch the thick, rough bark of this mature tree. Find a deep fissure in the bark, and put your nose into it to smell the sweet aromas of vanilla and butterscotch.",

Representatives from Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant services comprised the Corporation. The National Park Service approved it because it offered the opportunity for all religious faiths to have a place of worship. The idea was to build a permanent building near a site on the canyon rim already used for services, including a very popular Easter Sunrise service.<br /> <br /> Harold E. Wagoner, a member of the board of directors of the Church Architectural Guild of America, was selected as architect. Working within National Park Service guidelines to respect the natural environment and American Indian culture, he designed a structure that reflected the architectural style of a kiva, a place of worship used by native people in the Southwest. This design worked well since the National Park Service also required that no towers or specific religious symbols be used.<br /> <br /> Because the initial building site was on the rim of the canyon just west of today's Hermits Rest Route (red) shuttle stop, plans called for the main auditorium to have a sweeping canyon view from a multi-story, curved window placed behind the altar. A special hydraulic lift would raise and lower at least three different altar configurations for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant services. An organ placed on a small balcony, with wind chests and pipes located at different sections of the main chapel, would provide stereophonic sound effects.<br /> <br /> Even as fundraising efforts reached around the world, questions about whether the rim was an appropriate location for the structure resulted in delays. Some even argued that the building only remotely resembled a kiva, instead looking more like a huge spacecraft perched on the canyon rim. Donations were never quite enough to realize Wagoner's plans, and federal funding became involved. The building was ultimately redesigned and relocated away from the edge of the canyon. An appropriate site was chosen next to the existing Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and Shrine of the Ages was completed by 1970.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service took over ownership of the building in 1975, along with all maintenance, operational, and administrative duties.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Shrine of the Ages is a one-story building with limestone rubble walls that rise up and away from a central entranceway filled with three 20-foot (6 m) tall by 30-foot (9 m) wide towering T-shaped wooden arches. A couple ponderosa pine trees grow in the outdoor courtyard between the arches. Inside, a 250-plus seat auditorium with a large, multi-paned trapezoidal window wall is used by the National Park Service, Grand Canyon Conservancy, and others, and can also be rented for private functions. In the winter months, the nightly Evening Program is held inside the Shrine of the Ages, offering the opportunity to learn about a variety of Grand Canyon resources. Park rangers may discuss geology, human history, wildlife, the night sky, water resources, rock art, canyon hiking, and more. Special events, such as concerts or demonstrations, may take the place of a park ranger program allowing visiting artists, musicians, or students opportunities to present programs to the community and the general public.",

      "audioDescription": "Next to the 40-foot long South Kaibab Trailhead shuttle bus stop, a line of three-foot (1 m) tall limestone boulders line a four-foot (1.2 m) wide concrete sidewalk. There is a water filling station to the right about 10 feet (3 m) along the asphalt path leading from the bus stop to the trailhead. The water filling station is within a square enclosure surrounded by a chain link fence to prevent altercations between people and wildlife. Thirty feet to the right of the water station, a few picnic tables sit in a small clearing behind the boulders. To the right of the shuttle bus stop at the far end of the sidewalk are some vault toilets. Move north along the eight-foot wide asphalt trail 40 feet (12 m) to where the path turns right, and continue forward to a vertical wayside panel at the right opposite the trailhead. At the top left of the panel, a black and red circle surrounds a black-and-white image of Grand Canyon with large white letters urging you to, \"Hike Smart.\" Text reads: \"Welcome to South Kaibab Trail. This magnificent Grand Canyon is a vast and harsh wilderness demanding respect. Do You Have a Realistic Plan? Grand Canyon National Park assists more than 600 hikers during the hot summer months and helicopter rescues an additional 150 people...You are responsible for your safety and the safety of your friends and family. Rescue is not a guarantee. Have You Checked the Weather? Summer temperatures in the shade reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) below Skeleton Point and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius) at Phantom Ranch. In winter, temperatures drop below freezing with steep, icy trails requiring shoe traction devices.\" At the upper right, a map of the trail shows distances and elevations. Text continues: \"How Much Food and Water Should You Bring? Your body needs energy - balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success...To the right, a list of standard trail courtesy items appear.\" At the bottom left, the panel states: \"Never approach, touch, or feed any animal. It is dangerous...and illegal to do so. Pets are not allowed on the trails. If you wish to take a service animal with you, please check in at the Backcountry Information Center.\"",

You can smell them, hear their brays, see them snake down trails like trains, feel them as you sway on their saddled backs, and even taste their dust as they pass you on the trail. A cross between a male donkey and a female horse, mules are sensitive spirits in robust bodies. Grand Canyon is one of the few remaining places in the United States where mules are a common sight. Once prevalent on American farms, they are now largely replaced by tractors and trucks. At Grand Canyon, they excel at the jobs they are bred for: pack work and riding.\" Text at the lower left continues: \"For more than a century, mules have carried almost everything imaginable in and out of Grand Canyon. With only trails through the wilderness below the rim, the mules will likely work for a long time.\" A quote at the top center by Theodore H. Savory from Scientific American reads: \"The mule...is courageous and intelligent, hard of hide, sure of foot, sound of constitution and able to resist changes in climate and withstand thirst and hunger better than the horse.\" A green circle in the upper right-hand corner surrounds a park ranger hat with the words, \"Junior Ranger.\" Three figures in silhouette do the biological math showing how a female horse plus a male donkey equals a mule. Text continues: \"When a female horse is bred with a male donkey the offspring is a mule. The donkey gives the mule its short thick head, long ears, and short mane, while the horse shares its height and body shape. Mules come in all shapes and sizes, influenced largely by their mother. With all the breeds, like quarter horses, draft horses, or shaggy ponies, what kind of mule mix can you imagine? \"",

On either side of you, tall and densely clustered pine or aspen trees abruptly end at the edges of this large meadow. The open area that you see extends for miles.<br /> <br /> Why would these vibrant forests suddenly stop invading an open, rolling grassy landscape? Several factors are linked to this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> <b>Wildfire</b> has certainly played a role.<br /> <br /> <b>Drainage</b> is also a limiting factor. Trees are skilled at soaking up water, though seedlings may have a hard time growing in locations exposed to greater amounts of sun, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> <b>Soil chemistry</b> is also a consideration. Natural toxins and higher alkaline concentrations can prevent the growth of woody plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Competition</b> is significant. For example, Ponderosa pine trees struggle to grow in areas dominated by established grasses. <b>Variations in bedrock</b> (primarily Kaibab limestone) may also affect how deep or suitable an area is for seedling growth. And grazing <b>wildlife</b>, like mule deer and bison, keep vegetation low and trimmed.<br /> <br /> You can also observe this phenomenon along the beginning of Cape Royal Road, here on the North Rim.</p> <h3>Bison Safety</h3> <ul> <li>Bison are wild animals and are unpredictable.</li> <li>Maintain a distance of 100 feet (30 m) from bison.</li> <li>When the bison are within 100 feet (30 m) of the road, it is recommended to view wildlife from inside a vehicle.</li> <li>Please use established gravel or paved pull-outs to park vehicles completely off the roadway (all wheels right of the white line). Do not walk or park in the road.</li> </ul>",

The paving stones represent sandstones of the Dox Formation, while the seating rocks include several large pieces of Hotauta Conglomerate (the basal member of the Bass Formation) and Bass Limestone; one piece of purplish limestone bears striking ripple marks formed by flowing water.<br /> <br /> On the east side of the actual trail junction sits a large piece of Shinumo Quartzite, with an equally large piece of Sixtymile Conglomerate sitting next to it.<br /> <br /> Directly opposite these rocks, on the west side of the junction, sit two large stromatolite fossils, the top sides of which have been cut and polished.<br /> <br /> <strong>Walking west from here</strong> will take you to exhibits of the <strong>oldest rocks in Grand Canyon and\u00a0Grand Canyon Village.\u00a0</strong>0.6 mile (0.9 km).<br /> <br /> <strong>Walking east from here</strong> will take you through <strong>Grand Canyon's younger years to the present day and eventually to\u00a0Yavapai Geology Museum.\u00a0</strong>0.7 mile (1.13 km).</p> <h3>Trail of Time Overview</h3> <p>The Trail of Time is the world's largest geoscience exhibition at one of the world's grandest geologic landscapes, Grand Canyon National Park. The trail utilizes the unique vistas and rocks of Grand Canyon to help visitors ponder, explore, and understand the magnitude of geologic time and the stories encoded by Grand Canyon rocks and landscapes. Geologic time is immensely long. The 4.56 km (2.8 mi) trail is marked every meter, with 1 meter = 1 million years of our 4,560,000,000 year-long Earth history. Viewing tubes, rocks on plinths, and wayside panels help visitors connect the rocks visible in Grand Canyon to their place along the timeline.<br /> <br /> The main Trail of Time can be entered at different points - including the east end near Yavapai Point (young end), west end at Grand Canyon Village (old end), or a middle point where a connecting trail comes from the Park Headquarters parking area (Parking Lot A). Shuttle stops connect each entry point, so you can walk it in several ways and still get back to your car. The entry portals have messages on each side appropriate for those approaching (welcome) or for those completing different segments of the Trail (congratulations).<br /> <br /> Located on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, the Trail of Time extends along the paved Rim Trail between the Yavapai Geology Museum on the east and Maricopa Point on the west. The main portion of the Trail between Yavapai Geology Museum and Grand Canyon Village is accessible to wheelchairs and baby strollers, and it is convenient to shuttle bus stops and parking areas in a heavily-visited section of the park.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Trail of Time is a 3.1 mile (5 km) wheelchair accessible interactive trail that winds along the rim on a wide, relatively level paved surface. Along the side of the trail, low concrete pedestals display actual Grand Canyon rocks in a timeline of the canyon's geologic history. Bronze markers embedded in the sidewalk indicate at what point in time you are standing. At the intersection of the trail leading from the park headquarters to the Rim Trail, a six-foot (2 m) tall by four-foot (1.2 m) wide V-shaped rock column shows Grand Canyon's actual rock layers, brought up from deep in the canyon. Touch the column to feel the layers: the oldest black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom, topped by multi-colored diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, followed by more horizontal layers of rock with the Kaibab Formation at the top. Text on the south side of a three-foot (1 m) tall by two-foot (60 cm) wide panel embedded in the column reads: \"Welcome to the Trail of Time, a geology timeline. Walk 2 billion years of Grand Canyon history.\" See and touch samples of Grand Canyon rocks. Discover their ages! Go left to see Grand Canyon's oldest rocks. Go right to walk towards the present. An illustration at the bottom of the panel shows three people on the trail underneath a map of the Trail of Time along the rim of Grand Canyon. Text reads: \"One long step = 1 million years.\" A highlighted marker at their feet reads \"1,000 million years ago.\" In the center of the panel, a map shows the route of the Trail of Time along the rim. Text in a yellow box at the right of the map reads, \"You Are Here,\" indicating a point on the trail about halfway between the Village in the center and Yavapai Geology Museum at the right. Maricopa Point is at the far left, to the west. The map shows shuttle bus stops and parking lot locations, and the locations of several restrooms. At the top of the map, small bits of blue show the Colorado River flowing at the bottom of the canyon. Text on the opposite north side of the panel reads: \"You are leaving the Trail of Time, a geology timeline! Come back and walk the rest of the Trail of Time on your next visit.\" An illustration at the bottom of the panel underneath the same map shows an empty trail.",

      "bodyText": "<p>From the flagpole outside of Verkamp's Visitor Center, walk to the right along the rim trail and find the Trail of Time bronze markers embedded in the pavement. From the 2,000 million year marker, you can see the western entry portal for the Trail of Time. Walking east from Grand Canyon Village takes you forward in time, from Grand Canyon's oldest rocks to canyon carving and Grand Canyon's human history.<br /> <br /> This is the \"old\" end of the main Trail of Time, so the theme for the paving stones and seating rocks around the portal is Precambrian schist and gneiss of the type found in the inner gorges, near the bottom of the canyon. Walk a bit further east along the trail and you can see and touch the oldest known rock of Grand Canyon's basement rocks!</p> <h3>Trail of Time Overview</h3> <p>The Trail of Time is the world's largest geoscience exhibition at one of the world's grandest geologic landscapes, Grand Canyon National Park. The trail utilizes the unique vistas and rocks of Grand Canyon to help visitors ponder, explore, and understand the magnitude of geologic time and the stories encoded by Grand Canyon rocks and landscapes. Geologic time is immensely long. The 4.56 km (2.8 mi) trail is marked every meter, with 1 meter = 1 million years of our 4,560,000,000 year-long Earth history. Viewing tubes, rocks on plinths, and wayside panels help visitors connect the rocks visible in Grand Canyon to their place along the timeline.<br /> <br /> The main Trail of Time can be entered at different points - including the east end near Yavapai Point (young end), west end at Grand Canyon Village (old end), or a middle point where a connecting trail comes from the Park Headquarters parking area (Parking Lot A). Shuttle stops connect each entry point, so you can walk it in several ways and still get back to your car. The entry portals have messages on each side appropriate for those approaching (welcome) or for those completing different segments of the Trail (congratulations).<br /> <br /> Located on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, the Trail of Time extends along the paved Rim Trail between the Yavapai Geology Museum on the east and Maricopa Point on the west. The main portion of the Trail between Yavapai Geology Museum and Grand Canyon Village is accessible to wheelchairs and baby strollers, and it is convenient to shuttle bus stops and parking areas in a heavily-visited section of the park.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Trail of Time is a 3.1 mile (5 km) wheelchair accessible interactive trail that winds along the rim on a wide, relatively level paved surface. Along the side of the trail, low concrete pedestals display actual Grand Canyon rocks in a timeline of the canyon's geologic history. Bronze markers embedded in the sidewalk indicate at what point in time you are standing. Moving along the trail from Verkamp's Visitor Center, a six-foot (2 m) tall by four-foot (1.2 m) wide V-shaped rock column shows Grand Canyon's actual rock layers, brought up from deep in the canyon. Touch the column to feel the layers: the oldest black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom, topped by multi-colored diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, followed by more horizontal layers of rock with the Kaibab Formation at the top. Text on the west side of a three-foot (1 m) tall by two-foot (60 cm) wide panel embedded in the column reads: \"Welcome to the Trail of Time, a geology timeline. Walk 2 billion years of Grand Canyon history. See and touch samples of Grand Canyon Rocks. Discover their ages!\" An illustration at the bottom of the panel shows an older couple walking along the trail next to a woman and her young son. Text reads: \"One long step = 1 million years.\" A highlighted marker at their feet reads: \"1,970 million years ago.\" In the center of the panel, a map shows the route of the Trail of Time along the rim. Text in a yellow box in the middle of the map reads, \"You Are Here,\" pointing to the trail behind the Verkamp's Visitor Center, next to other buildings in the Village. Maricopa Point is at the left, to the west. The Yavapai Geology Museum is at the far right to the east. The map shows shuttle bus stops and parking lot locations, and the locations of several restrooms. At the top of the map, small bits of blue show the Colorado River flowing at the bottom of the canyon. Text on the opposite east side of the panel reads: \"Congratulations! You have just walked the Trail of Time, a geology timeline covering 2 billion years of Grand Canyon history.\" Continue through the Village to Maricopa Point (2.5 km, 1.5 mi.) to the age of the Earth. An illustration at the bottom of the panel underneath the same map shows a man and woman looking west over the canyon toward Maricopa Point.",

      "audioDescription": "From the Trailview Overlook shuttle bus stop, two ramps lead north through the low limestone wall lining the sidewalk. A couple wooden benches sit on a flat, pebbly area on the other side of the wall between the two entrance points, across some low limestone boulders lining the asphalt path. Ten feet (3 m) to the east of a vertical wayside panel with an eight-foot (2.4 m) wide limestone base, a long set of concrete stairs, four-feet (1.2 m) wide with metal handrails on both sides, leads down to an overlook. Move 16 steps down to a concrete sidewalk. Follow 20 feet (6 m) along the right handrail to two more steps, then continue 20 feet (6 m) forward to where another set of stairs leads down to the right with handrails on both sides. Follow along the right handrail to move down a series of staircases and landings down a total of 54 stairs to an asphalt-paved path. Turn left and continue 25 feet (8 m) along the handrail at your right to an overlook area ringed by a four-foot (1.2 m) high metal railing. At the left, text on a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel reads: Breaking Ground Look down Garden Creek Canyon at the winding Bright Angel Trail. The Earth\u2019s crust fractured in this area, lifting one side of the rock layers and lowering the other, creating a fault. The trail follows this fault into the canyon. Water also follows the fault. Springs, like those at Indian Garden, are able to flow because the groundwater has reached impermeable rock, where it spreads out sideways and leaks out of the canyon walls as springs. A picture of the canyon from this vantage point fills the bottom two-thirds of the panel. A thick yellow line in the middle of the panel shows the location of the Bright Angel Fault, running across the bottom of the canyon through Indian Garden all the way across to the North Rim. A circular picture inset at the lower left shows your location as viewed from the North Rim of the canyon. Two cliff faces are highlighted with arrows, one pointing down, the other pointing up. A caption reads: Sixty million years ago the west side of Bright Angel Fault was lifted higher than the east side.",

The first train arrived in 1901, bringing passengers ready to marvel at Grand Canyon's one-of-a-kind views. Today this feeling continues as folks step off the train, eager to make the walk up towards El Tovar Hotel and the canyon rim.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1909-1910, the Train Depot is part of the Grand Canyon National Park National Historic Landscape District and a designated National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect Francis W. Wilson of Santa Barbara, California, the log and wood-frame structure is two stories high.<br /> <br /> Originally, the downstairs was designated for station facilities and the station agent's family inhabited the upstairs. Today, the first floor is used for railway passenger services. The building is one of 14 log depots constructed in the United States and one of only three remaining. Of the three, the Train Depot is the only one in which logs were used as the primary structural material and which still serves an operating railroad. The depot's logs are squared on three sides creating bearing surfaces, flat interior surfaces, and a rustic exterior appearance.<br /> <br /> Just beyond the depot is the El Tovar Hotel, built in 1905 by the Santa Fe Railroad. The structure is the signature hotel along the rim. The railroad built the Train Depot five years after the hotel and placed it conveniently close for the rail passengers.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Grand Canyon Railway Depot sits at the end of the railroad tracks down the hill from El Tovar. The main facade faces south, away from the canyon.<br />The 3,000-square foot (900 square meter) log structure is primarily a one-story building with a broad, moderately-pitched gable roof with the ridge running on the long axis, parallel to the four sets of train tracks, thirty feet (9 m) across. A frame second story occupies the center third of the building, sheathed with flush planking framed by vertical log posts. This central portion is covered with another broad gabled roof at right angles to the main roof. The second story overhangs the first, supported by heavy vertical log posts, and an attic overhangs the second story, supported by log brackets. An extension of the main roof to the west at a slightly lower elevation shelters a large two-bay porch, supported on vertical log posts, and a small one-story bay projects slightly from the central block. Note there is a set of men's restrooms outside on the back-north side of the building, towards the east.<br />Inside, there are four main rooms. From west to east there is a ticket office-waiting room with several wooden benches and metal railings, an agent's office, a parcel storage room and a baggage room. Family and women's restrooms are between these rooms and the platform. Interior walls are plastered with log-slab wainscoting. Note that much of the original hardware is present. Feel the doorknobs, stamped with the letters, \"GC.\"<br />Back outside, there are a couple picnic tables underneath a tree to the east of the station next to the tracks.<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, just east of the large two-bay porch, an old black-and-white picture of the train station fills the top of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top left reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Depot <br />In 1901, the screech of train brakes and the blast of a train whistle signaled the arrival of a new era in Grand Canyon Village. The railroad provided the most comfortable means of transportation to the canyon for more than a quarter century. This log depot, finished in 1910, welcomed train passengers to a growing village. By 1924, a community development plan was created for the village. Almost a century later, that planned community forms the core of Grand Canyon Village, centering on the last operational log depot in the country. Today, the depot is carefully preserved and still welcomes passengers to the canyon.\"<br />A smaller black-and-white picture at the lower left shows a black steam engine trailed by several cars next to a small wooden structure at the left. A caption reads:<br />\"The original depot was a small shack located west of here. The need for a larger, more sophisticated structure quickly became apparent.\"<br />Two more black-and-white photos along the right side of the panel show long lines of a half-dozen trains in front of the depot, and a parking lot full of vintage cars next to the tracks. A caption reads:<br />These photos depict a thriving Grand Canyon rail operation, but with the opening of the paved automotive highway from Williams, Arizona, in 1926, that began to change. Ridership declined for decades. Finally, in 1968, the passenger service and depot closed.<br />A color photograph at the bottom right shows a black steam engine and coal car with several trailing cars in front of the station. Another caption reads:<br />\"In 1989, passenger service resumed, bringing thousands of visitors to Grand Canyon by rail each year. Traveling this way lessens auto congestion on traffic-busy park roads.\"<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, beside two large logs in the middle of the two-bay porch, is an 18-inch (46 cm) square metal plaque mounted on an angle to the top of a four-foot (1.2 m) tall wooden pedestal. Text on the plaque reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Railway Depot has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America, 1987, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior.\"",

      "audioDescription": "About 300 feet (90 m) east of El Tovar and Hopi House sits the grey-shingled, two-story Verkamp's Visitor Center. Nearby, an old black-and-white picture of the structure fill a three-foot (1 m) tall, angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top left reads: \"Verkamp's Curios Store Inspired by Grand Canyon's burgeoning tourism trade, in 1898, John Verkamp established a small tent shop on the South Rim, selling American Indian arts and crafts. Profits proved meager, so John sold his inventory to the Bright Angel Hotel and closed his shop. Returning in 1905, John built the permanent store you see today. His business prospered; indeed, it was his only business to survive the Great Depression. In 1936, John, his wife, and their four children moved into the apartment above the store. John managed the store until his death in 1944. His children, and eventually his grandchildren, operated the store. When it closed in 2008, it was the last echo of the canyon's pioneer businesses.\" A caption underneath the photograph reads: \"Verkamp hired El Tovar architect Charles F. Whittlesey to design his new store. Today, it serves as a visitor center.\" At the top right, an entry from John Verkamp's ledger on the opening day of his permanent curios store, January 31, 1906, reads: \"$4.98. A good day.\" A black-and-white photograph inset at the lower left shows a man in a light-colored suit and vest standing before a makeshift white tent. A caption reads: \"Verkamp traded flour, sugar, and other things to local tribes in exchange for hand-made jewelry, rugs, and pottery which he sold from this tent in 1898.\" Note there is a water filling station about 12 feet (3.6 m) to the left of this wayside.",

Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, about five miles (eight kilometers) south of the \u2018Y,\u2019 past a series of curvy switchbacks, a small pullout to the left leads to the one-lane parking area of Vista Encantada. At the north end of the pullout, a line of parking spaces faces a six-foot wide asphalt sidewalk and the rim. Further south, additional parallel parking spaces line the sidewalk. Towards the middle, the sidewalk loops toward the rim (east) to encircle an eight-foot (two-and-a-half meter) tall, double-sided, wooden wayside with a small shingle roof sitting atop a three-foot tall by four-foot wide (90 by 120 centimeter) stone base. Flat boulders ring the edge of the wayside sidewalk loop at the rim, behind a few tall Ponderosa pine trees and the canyon vista beyond. Note there are no guardrails. To the south of the wayside beyond the sidewalk, note a 15 foot (six meter) wide dirt and gravel area in front of the rim, under a tall Ponderosa pine and a large boulder at the rim itself. If you visit during the summer, Vista Encantada may be bursting with orange and yellow wildflowers, and blooming prickly pear cactus. September through December, the small fruit turns ruby red when ripe. Continuing south along the sidewalk from the wayside overlook, the path curves around to a fork where a second asphalt loop path leads left into and around a grove of trees. Under the canopy are a half-dozen picnic tables. About 20 feet (six meters) along the left-hand hand path, a wooden bench at the left peers out over the edge of the canyon. Note a pair of wildlife-proof, metal garbage cans by the sidewalk in front of the picnic area.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 4, Walhalla Glades Pueblo. 1 \u00be minutes. The Walhalla Glades Pueblo is located across the road from entrance to the Walhalla Overlook pullout. Being mindful of traffic, move across the road to a flat gravel path lined with logs that leads about 400 feet (120 meters) north to an open area among the surrounding trees. Low, stacked limestone rock wall remnants outline the footprints of the half-dozen rooms of the pueblo. There is set of main rooms straight ahead, ranging in size from 10 to 15 feet (three to five meters) wide, and 10 to 20 feet (three to six meters) long. Note that this is an archeological site, and federal penalties can be imposed upon anyone who disturbs it. Touching or walking on the walls is not allowed, and removing any artifacts from this location is prohibited. Remains of adobe and beams in the rubble of these rooms indicated that the stone-walled rooms had roofs through which people entered by ladder. Near the north wall of the second room is a small, slab-lined fire pit. There are two smaller, separate rooms here to the west, and at the far end of the pueblo, a visible entryway connects the two large rooms built at the back. In the middle of the far wall of the last big room, stands a large, limestone slab, placed on-edge. Note to the west of the two back rooms of the main pueblo, two long rows of half-log benches face the pueblo under the trees. A second set of pueblo room remains stand to the east of the main pueblo, closer to the road. Consisting of one large and two smaller rooms, there is archaeological evidence these structures were built after the main structure burned down.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 3, Walhalla Overlook. 1 \u00bd minutes. Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, about six and a half miles (10 kilometers) past Roosevelt Point, a pullout to the left leads to a one-lane road beside the Walhalla Overlook, with parking on either side. Note a small wood and stone bench shelter and a wildlife-proof garbage can at the head (north end) of the lot. A five foot (two meter) wide asphalt sidewalk stretches over 500 feet (150 meters) south between the parking lane curb and a line of boulders at the edge of the canyon. About 150 feet (45 meters) along the sidewalk, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail tells the story of Puebloan farmers who once made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At this location, far below us, the Unkar Creek has carved a wide swath of rocky walls and sloping banks that open up to a panorama of the canyon floor and Unkar Delta. Fifteen miles (24 kilometers) in the distance, the walls of the South Rim rise steeply to a flat, desert plain. Much closer, off to the right, just beyond the point at Cape Royal, Vishnu Temple rises 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) into the air, topped with a pyramid-like limestone caprock. Sub-Script Living Delta to Rim Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Walhalla Overlook fills the face of the panel. Entitled \u201cLiving Delta to Rim,\u201d words at the top of the panel read: From the North Rim, the Colorado River and the Unkar Delta below seem distant, yet ancestral Puebloan farmers 1,100 to 800 years ago made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis, spending summers on the rim and most of the remainder of the year within the canyon. For nearly five generations (about 100 years) farmers moved between Unkar Delta and Walhalla Glades, their summer home (across the road behind you). They successfully planted crops along the river, near water sources in side canyons, and on the North Rim. Corn, beans, and squash were their principle crops, but they also supplemented their diet with wild game, leafy plants, roots, nuts, and berries. The stone foundations of their dwellings, along with the artifacts left behind, tell stories of vibrant communities living in the harsh canyon environment. At the left, a white line from the Unkar Delta, far below in the center of the panel, connects to a circular inset photograph of rows of rocks arranged in neat squares and rectangles on the ground. A caption reads: Archaeologists can still piece together the stories of Unkar Delta\u2019s ancient farming communities, even though floods have washed much of the evidence away. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of more low, interconnected stone walls in a grove of trees. Text reads: Camp Walhalla Glades If you have been to summer camp, you probably traveled there by car or bus. Ancestral Puebloan children walked and climbed miles to their summer camp (across the road behind you), called Walhalla Glades. Find their winter home in the view and see if you can plot a route the children might have followed to camp. \u2003",

      "audioDescription": "Situated on prominent Yavapai Point, Yavapai Geology Museum is an irregularly-shaped one-story building, approximately 40-feet (12 m) deep by 65-feet (20 m) wide, with a semi-circular observation enclosed terrace on the north side overlooking the canyon. The structure's exterior walls and foundation are made of uniformly-sized, native Kaibab Formation boulders with buttressed corners which give the building a rich variation in form, texture, and line. The building has a low, flat asphalt roof, timber beams, and protruding wood rafters. Other rustic characteristics include small window openings, and timber doors. The splayed courses of the building merge into the surrounding curbing and paving stones. Inside, a vast 3,000 square foot (900 square meter) room houses a wide variety of geology exhibits that showcase the canyon's history, including a scale model of Grand Canyon, samples of its geologic layers, plant and animal fossils, specimens of modern flora and fauna common to the region, and maps and charts for public use. The entire north wall is covered with a series of five 10-foot (3 m) wide by five-foot (1.5 m) tall windows with sweeping views of the North Rim, the inner canyon, and the Colorado River far below. A variety of interpretive displays explain the deposition of the canyon's strata, the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, and the role of the Colorado River in carving Grand Canyon over time. These exhibits are augmented by daily interpretive talks conducted by National Park Service park rangers about Grand Canyon's geologic history. There is a small Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store on the opposite side of the room from the windows at the left. While there are no restrooms inside the museum, they are available down a short paved trail at the parking lot.",

Two uneven stone steps lead down into the amphitheater from the trail at the west. Fifty-feet (15 m) farther east along the trail, a paved asphalt ramp leads north down a slight incline into the theater. Be mindful of a small step as you move off the path onto the dirt.
