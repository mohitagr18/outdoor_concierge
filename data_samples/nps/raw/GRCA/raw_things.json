      "audioDescription": "This site is located at the western end of Grand Canyon Village, 300 feet (90 m) west of Hermits Rest Route Transfer along the paved Rim Trail. Twenty feet (6 m) to the canyon side of the trail, a three-foot (1 m) tall by six-foot (2 m) wide square stone altar stands roughly six feet (2 m) from the rim of Grand Canyon, near the end of a flat, 30-foot (9 m) wide by 60-foot (18 m) long open, pebble-strewn landing. Be mindful stepping over a line of rocks bordering the edge of the asphalt trail onto the loose footing of the landing. Touch the stones that form the altar. Facing north down into the canyon, numerous switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail run up to and past 3-Mile Resthouse, and continue into the distance toward a stand of trees at Indian Garden far below. To the right across the chasm, perched on the edge of the canyon cliffs, is the multi-level dark brown Kolb Studio surrounded by evergreen trees below and behind the building. To the right of the studio, hikers enter and leave the canyon at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Above the trailhead, a few parking lots in the Village sit behind Bright Angel Lodge. The turreted top of El Tovar Hotel rises in the background, high above the rim. Located opposite the Rim Trail Worship Site on the other side of the asphalt path, away from the canyon, is a several-hundred-square-foot (90 meters square) gently-sloping rocky area filled with fossils. Note that once off the Rim Trail, the terrain quickly becomes rough, uneven and rocky, interspersed throughout with prickly pear cactus, juniper, and fir trees. Rocky escarpments stand exposed across the field, some three- to four-feet (1 to 1.2 m) high and tens of feet (10 m) long. On this west side of the Bright Angel Fault line, sedimentary rock layers have been uplifted, exposing an amazing diversity of rock formations with an abundance of fossils and trace fossils hidden within the youngest layer of Grand Canyon, the Kaibab Limestone. Common marine fossils include crinoids, animals that had a column-shaped body, created by a series of discs stacked together, topped by a cup-like head feeding structure radiating out like feathery arms. Shelled marine animals known as brachiopods had two asymmetrical shells, or valves. Several different species of brachiopods can easily be found here.Colonial animals called bryozoans produced lacy structures on hard surfaces or stick structures that stood up in ancient seas. Some solitary coral embedded the pointed end of its horn in the soft sediment for stability with a wider upright cup-like end. Sponge fossils are abundant as well. When they hardened into rock, they are more resistant to erosion and often stick out as large knobs or nodules from the surrounding limestone. Animals burrowed through the soft sediment at the bottom of ancient seas. Look for all manner of preserved burrows that were filled in with sediment. These could be long, short, wide, or thin tubular-looking structures. Many plant fossils also remain, such as small pines and ginkgoes. Most of the plant fossils are impressions called trace fossils, left behind in the mud of an ancient river system. Note that it is illegal to dig up, relocate, and/or remove fossils from Grand Canyon National Park. If you find a fossil, please leave it for others to discover and scientists to study. You are welcome to take a picture or make a drawing of the fossil, then go to one of the visitor centers to see if a park ranger can help you identify it.",

Note that about 8 feet (2.4 m) beyond the far end of the desk is a large, 10-foot (3 m) wide by 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, limestone fireplace with a couple wooden benches at the left and right up a small 6-inch (150 cm) step. Another hallway to the left at the far end of the desk leads to a water fountain and an ATM machine. The Bright Angel History Room is on the right. A set of restrooms is available straight ahead down this hallway and down a small flight of six stairs. Outside, on the canyon side of the lodge, a flagstone bench with a stone slab back rings a planter at the center of a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace. Several other stone benches sit across the terrace, and there is a soda fountain and ice cream shop toward the east side of the building. At the far eastern end of the lodge is the Arizona Room restaurant, with its own separate entrance. From a position facing the Bright Angel Lodge reception desk, move to the far right-hand side of the desk and turn left. Move about 15 feet (4.5 m) forward, and turn right to move across the stone floor, then over a wooden threshold and through a set of eight-foot wide wooden sliding pocket doors onto a carpeted floor. You are in a 25-foot (8 m) wide by 20-foot (6 m) deep room with exposed timbers. The Bright Angel History Room highlights the legacy of Fred Harvey, Mary Jane Colter, and the Santa Fe Railway at Grand Canyon National Park and throughout the Southwest. On the wall to your left and along the left-hand wall are a series of exhibits about Fred Harvey in Arizona. On the wall to your right are a series of exhibits on Harvey at the Canyon, including an open, three-seat carriage with a roof. Four six-foot (2 m) tall floor-standing glass-enclosed display cases in the center left and right of the room display artifacts used and sold in Harvey's company restaurants and gift shops along the Santa Fe main line from Chicago to Los Angeles. A small gift shop and check-out counter sit in the back-right corner. On the opposite side of the room from the door, two five-foot (1.5 m) square picture windows frame a 10-foot (3 m) tall by 10-foot (3 m) wide stone fireplace. Designed by Mary Colter, its construction mirrors a typical cross-section of the canyon's geology. The roughly triangular outline represents the alternating slopes and cliffs seen in the profile of the canyon's walls. Be mindful of the two-inch (5 cm) high dark-stone Vishnu Schist that forms the hearth at the bottom and the metal andirons at the front left and right. Feel how the rock layers of the fireplace mimic the canyon. Touch the diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup next to the fireplace opening, topped by the narrow horizontal layers of the Paleozoic era. The top layer is the Kaibab Formation, the youngest and uppermost layer of rock in Grand Canyon. Five steps at the front left of the one-story limestone brick Bright Angel Lodge lead up under a simple shallow-pitched gable roof, forming a 10-foot (3 m) deep by 50-foot (15 m) wide covered gabled porch supported by peeled log posts. Six large exposed timbers support a triangular sloping shingled roof, 20-feet (6 m) tall at the center over the main entrance. Designed by architect Mary Jane Colter, Bright Angel Lodge is a complex of cabins around a central lodge building, directly on the edge of the canyon. Four windows penetrate the stone fa\u00e7ade of the lodge. Two glass and metal hurricane lamps hang eight-feet (2.4 m) high to the left and right of the main entrance. A brightly painted eight-foot (2.4 m) wide wood and glass vestibule stands in front of the doors with blue and yellow vertical stripes, inlaid with red and white triangles outlined in black. Shed-roofed appendages create a layered effect for the mass of the main lodge. Outside on the canyon side of the lodge, a 100-foot (30 m) long by 80-foot (24 m) wide flagstone terrace leads right up to a 3-foot (1 m) tall limestone wall on the edge of the rim.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 24, Bright Angel Point. 1 minute. From A D Stop 23, the asphalt path to Bright Angel Point continues about a quarter mile (400 meters) east. Note the paved path becomes increasingly steep, and there are no guardrails along the path to Bright Angel Point. The paved Bright Angel Point Trail leads out the spine of the ridge to Bright Angel Point. This trail is steep in places, with drop-offs and stairs, and provides dramatic views into Roaring Springs and Bright Angel Canyons. At the end of the trail is a narrow overlook, surrounded by four-foot (one meter) tall metal railings. A three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail stands at the edge of the rim at the far end of the overlook. Entitled \u201cBreaking Ground,\u201d the panel discusses the fracturing that created Bright Angel fault. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Breaking Ground Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon view from this location at Bright Angel Point fills the panel. At the top left, words read: Breaking Ground Look down Bright Angel Canyon where North Kaibab Trail winds. The Earth\u2019s crust fractured in this area, lifting one side of the rock layers and lowering the other, creating a fault. The trail follows this fault into the canyon. Water also follows the fault. Springs, like Roaring Springs, are able to flow because the groundwater has reached impermeable rock, where it spreads out sideways and leaks out of the canyon walls as springs. At the left, a white label and line indicate the location of Walhalla Plateau. At the bottom center, a second white label points out Bright Angel Fault. The deep fault continues to the right, all the way to a third label at the right of the panel, Phantom Ranch. At the right, an inset color illustration shows a cross-section of the canyon, with the fault in the middle. A caption reads: Sixty million years ago the west side of Bright Angel Fault was lifted higher than the east side.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 21, Bright Angel Point Amphitheater + Wayside. 1 minute. The Ranger talk area is located to the southeast of Grand Canyon Lodge along the Bright Angel Point trail. From a position along the access ramp at the back of the lodge complex, move about 250 feet (75 meters) east away from the lodge complex along a concrete sidewalk. Continue past several cabins at the left and right, and through a small grove of ponderosa pine, to where the pavement changes from concrete to asphalt. Continue about 75 feet (23 meters) to a number of wooden benches arranged in a semi-circle at the left. A wooden sign at the left tells us that during the season, ranger programs are held here daily. At the far side of the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the right, a mere 10 feet (three meters) from the rim, talks about how the different horizontal layers of the canyon were formed. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cLayered Environments,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Layered Environments Wayside Panel A color photograph of the canyon from this vantage point fills the left side of the panel. Words at the top left read: Layered Environments Tropical seas, coastal beaches, sand dunes, swamps, lagoons, and Sahara-like deserts are encapsulated within the horizontal layers that fill the view. The upper five layers of prominently stacked rocks record 70 million years of rising and falling sea levels. The limestone layers equate to shallow sea environments, sandstone layers mean sandy beaches or dunes, while shale layers translate to mud flats, swamps, or coastal plains. How do we know all this? The rocks tell us, through their fossils, mineral grains, and structures. Beneath the text, white lettering and lines point to the different formations. Top to bottom on the image, there is Kaibab limestone, the Toroweap Formation, Coconino Sandstone, the Hermit Formation, and the Supai Group. At the right, several color illustrations depict the environments that gave rise to these formations, in that same order. At the top, a shark and other ancient sea creatures swim in an ocean, above many plants and shelled creatures on the seabed. Text reads: The Kaibab sea advanced as far as modern-day eastern Arizona, depositing marine fossils including crinoids, shells, and shark\u2019s teeth. A mix of beach (sandstone) and sea (limestone) environments were embedded in the Toroweap, indicating a short advance and retreat of the sea. In the second image, a reptilian creature slithers across wide sand dunes. Text reads: Crossbed sands in the Coconino Sandstone depict scenes of shifting sand dunes, where reptiles left their tracks. In a third image, large animals, insects, and plants thrive by a marshy lake. Words read: The Hermit Formation was once a broad coastal plain evidenced by deposits of silt, mud, and fine-grain sand with an abundance of fern and animal track fossils. The last image at the bottom right depicts a wide expanse of shallow pools and plants across a sandy landscape. Words read: The Supai Group\u2019s mix of shale, siltstone, sandstone, and limestone represents a period of rapidly changing coastlines and rising and falling sea levels. A quote from John Strong Newberry at the bottom left reads: Nowhere on the earth\u2019s surface . . . are the secrets of its structure so revealed as here. A D Stop 22, Wayside 1 \u2013 On path to Bright Angel Point. \u00bd minute. About 75 feet (23 meters) east along the asphalt path from the Bright Angel Point Amphitheater, the path turns right down an increasing decline. About 40 feet (12 meters) further along, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the left discusses where the drinking water in the canyon comes from. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cDrink in the View,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script Drink in the View Wayside Panel A color photograph of a tall, rocky cliff with a gushing stream of water falling from its base fills the right side of the panel. Text at the top left reads: Drink in the View You have reached a special view, overlooking Roaring Springs Canyon. Drink in the canyon view here\u2014literally. Roaring Springs provides drinking water for both the North and South rims. If you fill your bottle at the lodge or campground, you are drinking Roaring Springs water. At the left, the first of three, circular, inset color photographs shows the rim of the canyon covered in snow. Text reads: Because the North Rim is higher than the South Rim, it receives more precipitation, particularly snowfall. As the snow melts water seeps into the ground. The second inset color photograph shows a stream of water rushing down a rocky, green slope. A caption reads: Some of the water moves quickly through cracks in the rock to the Roaring Springs aquifer, a natural holding tank. In the third inset photograph at the bottom left, water drips into a rocky pool. A caption reads: Some water moves through tight fractures or pores in the rock layers, taking longer paths to reach the spring\u2019s aquifer. At the top right, a final, color inset photographs shows a view of Grand Canyon Lodge from below, next to an image of a gushing water spigot. A caption reads: Water is tapped at Roaring Springs and pumped to the North and South rims. A D Stop 23, Wayside 2 \u2013 On path to Bright Angel Point. \u00bd minute. Continuing along the asphalt path toward Bright Angel Point, about 60 feet (18 meters) beyond A D stop 22, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail at the edge of the rim at the right discusses where the air quality in the canyon. A description of this panel, entitled \u201cHow\u2019s the View,\u201d is included in the sub-script below. Sub-Script How\u2019s the View Wayside Panel Two horizontal, color photographs of the same canyon view split the panel into top and bottom halves. In the top photograph, distant mountain ridges at the left, labeled \u2018San Francisco Peaks,\u2019 are visible above the canyon rim. Haze obscures the peaks in the bottom photograph. Words at the top left read: How\u2019s the View? If you are standing here in summer, your view of the San Francisco Peaks is probably hazy. The air pollutants that cause haze can be from local forest fires, but usually they are from distant urban and industrial areas hundreds of miles to the south and west. Because views are so essential to enjoying Grand Canyon, the park has been monitoring visibility since the 1970s. The good news is that the park\u2019s clearest days have gotten clearer in recent years. The bad news is that the haziest days have stayed about the same. An inset map at the top right shows Grand Canyon National Park in the center, with two large, brown arrows pointing up to the canyon from the south. A caption reads: Since most of Grand Canyon\u2019s air pollution comes from distant sources, the National Park Service works with states and tribes to help clear the air there and here. A caption at the bottom right of the top photograph reads: Air pollution affects your canyon experience; the more haze in the air the less vivid Grand Canyon\u2019s colors and forms. A caption at the bottom right of the bottom photograph reads: Pollution-caused haze can get so bad that on some days you can barely see the San Francisco Peaks, 66 miles (106 km) away.",

Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building. The hotel, including Buckey's cabin, was sold to Martin Buggeln in 1901, and was later acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad after the completion of the El Tovar Hotel in 1905. The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge.

After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A 4-foot (1.2 m) wide asphalt sidewalk rings the parking lot at Buggeln picnic area. Facing away from the lot, a number of picnic tables are available down a short, steep embankment, nestled among several ponderosa pine and Gambel oak trees. Note there is a unisex vault toilet at the far left-hand side of the lot. Along the path in the middle of the parking lot, a color photograph of a stand of Gambel oak trees fills the left-hand side of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top right reads: \"Welcomed Mix Each ponderosa pine forest is unique. Here at Buggeln picnic area ponderosa pine shares the forest with Gambel oak, resulting in a diverse and rich community of plants and animals. Gambel oak shelters wildlife and attracts higher insect populations. Its acorns and foliage feed golden-mantled ground squirrels, wild turkeys, and common porcupines. Decomposing oak leaves improve soil conditions for grasses, wildflowers, and woody shrubs. Experienced birdwatchers consider these forests hot spots for birds. You man spy uncommon birds here, like Grace's and Virginia's warblers. Pine-oak forests are valuable to native people. For centuries, area tribes have gathered a wide array of foods, medicines, and natural dyes in these productive woods.\" Several inset color photographs across the center of the panel show a dark slate gray Northern goshawk with pale-gray barred underparts, a checkered black-and-white downy woodpecker with a small red patch on the back of its head, a small gray and white Virginia's warbler, and a black wild turkey with a red wattle. Other photographs show the small red and yellow flowers of the wax currant, and the small greenish-white to pink flower clusters of the snowberry. Text at the bottom left of the panel reads: \"Gambel oak often associates with ponderosa pine at elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet (1,800-2,400 m). Fires visit this forest every 5 to 7 years. Low-intensity ground fires cycle nutrients into the soil to help this forest combination thrive.\" Next to a picture of a mountain lion at the bottom right, a caption reads: \"Feeding wildlife upsets the balance of this natural forest community. Please don't share your picnic!\"",

This site marks where CCC workers built the transcanyon telephone line in 1935. A short walk straight ahead to the stone wall will show you a plaque commemorating their work and give you a view of the old telephone poles.<br /> <br /> Today the transcanyon telephone line has largely been replaced by more modern methods of communication, although short sections of telephone poles installed over 80 years ago are still used today.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Along the Rim Trail near the El Tovar Hotel, a 12- by 14-inch (30- by 35-cm) bronze plaque set in a stone masonry pedestal sits attached to the limestone wall along the edge of the canyon. An inscription reads: \"Trans Canyon Telephone Line built in 1935 by CCC workers, maintained by Mountain Bell, has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, by the United States Department of the Interior.\" Peering over the edge of the wall, a two-foot (60 cm) tall galvanized pole can be seen sticking out of the ground with a metal crossbar. A copper wire runs across the top of the crossbar. An old black-and-white picture in the center of a nearby three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel shows a man perched atop a similar, taller steel pole steadied by a second man on the ground. Text at the left reads: \"CCC Legacy. The nearby plaque commemorates an amazing feat achieved by members of the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) in the 1930s - construction of a telephone line spanning the entire width of Grand Canyon. One of the poles still stands behind this wall. Beginning in 1934, CCC enrollees worked through winter snow and summer heat to survey and clear a right-of-way roughly following the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. Supplied by pack mules, they set 592 galvanized pipe telephone poles and completed stringing the 18 miles (29 km) of copper-weld wire in 1935.\" A quote from Robert L. Robeson, a CCC Enrollee, at the top right of the panel reads: \"Maybe those mountains are hard to climb. Those trees so hard to cut. But the air is pure, the water fine. And we're climbing right out of the rut...For besides helping ourselves, you see. We are helping Mother and Dad.\" Two additional black-and-white pictures inset at the right of the panel show workers building the stone wall before you, and a line of flat-bed trucks filled with young men. A caption reads: \"At Grand Canyon, today's visitors still benefit from the labor and skills of seven CCC companies. During the Great Depression, these young men constructed trails, roads, walls, fences, reservoirs, fire towers, buildings, power lines, telephone lines, and more.\"",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>Desert View Point (Elevation: 7438 feet/ 2267 meters)</strong>\u00a0<br /> <br /> Starting from the main Desert View parking area, a short .25 mile (.4 km) walk takes you past restrooms, the general store/market and the trading post.\u00a0The point itself is located a few steps beyond the base of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-watchtower.htm\">historic Watchtower</a>. There are guardrails around the cliff edge for your safety.<br /> <br /> Directly below is the Colorado River's \"Big Bend\", where it dramatically shifts its previously southward course by executing a sharp 90-degree turn to the west, cutting directly into a major uplift on the Colorado Plateau known as the Kaibab Upwarp. Looking to the west, one can glimpse in the distance where the river plunges into the black, narrow, confined depths of the Granite Gorge.The airline distance to the opposite rim of the canyon is 18 miles; to the Colorado River, 4 miles. The river is about 300 feet wide as seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> To the east, several thousand feet below where you are now standing, is the broad expanse of a plateau known as the Marble Platform, which is part of the Navajo Nation. The brilliant colors of the Painted Desert can be glimpsed in the distance.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Also to the\u00a0east,\u00a0and situated back from the Canyon rim,\u00a0is a prominent flat-topped mesa\u00a0called Cedar Mountain. Just beyond this mountain the Little Colorado River gorge extends north and south as a crack in the surface of the earth. Tracing the gorge to the left, one may see where it connects with Grand Canyon. The point of connection is where Grand Canyon begins. From that point the Canyon extends 217 miles westward as measured by the Colorado River. Fifty miles of the canyon may be seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> Dark cliffs bordering the Colorado River below Desert View are composed of lavas resulting from volcanic activity long before the cutting of Grand Canyon began. For the most part the walls of Grand Canyon consist of material which hardened into rock after being deposited by wind or water: Consequently, this lava rock is very different in origin and character from the rest of the rocks of the Canyon walls.</p> <h3>1956 Aviation Accident Memorial</h3> <p>At Desert View point, a National Historic Landmark plaque and stone memorial commemorate the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site,<strong> </strong>a horrific airline collision over\u00a0Grand Canyon that took place on June 30, 1956.\u00a0<br /> <br /> On that day,\u00a0a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon, and\u00a0killing all 128 people onboard the two flights. The tragedy spurred an unprecedented effort to modernize and increase safety in America\u2019s postwar airways, culminating in the establishment of the modern Federal Aviation Administration.\u00a0</p> <h3>National Historic Landmarks Program</h3> <p>The National Historic Landmarks Program, established in 1935, is administered by the National Park Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The agency works with preservation officials, private property owners, and other partners interested in nominating properties for National Historic Landmark designation. Completed nominations are reviewed by the National Park System Advisory Board, which makes recommendations for designation to the Secretary of the Interior. This site was dedicated as one of the nation's newest National Historic Landmarks on Tuesday, July 8, 2014.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "At an overlook area at the very northern tip of Desert View Point at Desert View Watchtower, an 18-inch (46 cm) square, metal plaque, embedded in a four-foot (1.2 m) tall by roughly two-foot (60 cm) wide limestone pillar reads: \u201c1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This tragic accident site represents a watershed moment in the modernization of America's airways leading to the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration and national standards for aviation safety. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America. 2014, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior.\" Nearby, a panoramic photograph of the canyon at this location fills a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the right reads: \"Tragedy Remembered\u2014Catastrophe can happen even in spectacular beauty. When technological achievements and human actions fail, disasters may happen. On June 30, 1956, a United Airlines DC-7 and TWA Super Constellation maneuvered around towering cumulus clouds on a partly clear day. All 128 passengers and crew perished when the planes collided at an altitude of 21,000 feet (6,400 m) above Temple and Chuar buttes. Passengers included prominent businesspeople and families. Every passenger had loved ones waiting for them, though their journey ended unexpectedly. The Grand Canyon disaster \"rocked the aviation world.\" It was the deadliest crash in American commercial aviation history at the time. Within a few years, the United States Congress created the Federal Aviation Administration to increase air safety. Due to its importance in aviation history, this hallowed ground is a National Historic Landmark. This designates and protects artifacts remaining in this remote area of the canyon and provides learning opportunities from that day and beyond.\" Two inset pictures at the bottom show additional monuments commemorating the crash with the text: \"Grand Canyon's Pioneer Cemetery (L) is the final resting place for 29 unidentified passengers from United Airlines. Recovery personnel removed the remains of the 70 accident victims from the TWA flight, and all but three were interred in a mass grave at Flagstaff Citizens Cemetery (R). Twenty-nine identified passengers were returned home for burial. Two smaller photographs show a corroded key and a rusty lighter, reminders of that day.\"",

From there, the Watchtower is in plain view.<br /> <br /> Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Watchtower was constructed in 1932. Architect Mary Colter\u2019s design takes its influences from the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloan people of the Colorado Plateau. This particular tower was patterned after those found at Hovenweep and the Round Tower of Mesa Verde. Colter indicated that it was not a copy of any that she had seen, but rather modeled from several.<br /> <br /> The view from the\u00a0Watchtower provides a unique perspective of the eastern portion of Grand Canyon. From here, looking to the northeast offers a distant glimpse of the Colorado River's transition from the relatively narrow Marble Canyon to the north into the much wider, broader expanse of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> For more about\u00a0what can be seen from here, view\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-point-1956-aviation-accident-memorial.htm\">Desert View Point.</a></p> <h3>The View Room</h3> <p>This lower floor of the tower, the View Room, is modeled after a traditional Native American kiva, and hosts cultural\u00a0demonstrations by indigenous artists during spring, summer and fall. A Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store is also located here.<br /> <br /> Inside the Watchtower View Room, views of the canyon,\u00a0through the different windows, are enhanced by looking through reflectoscopes\u00a0\u2014viewing instruments that use\u00a0polished black glass mirrors to cut\u00a0through the haze and glare of bright sunlight\u00a0and more clearly highlight\u00a0the canyon's multi-colored layers.<br /> <br /> The View Room, which for years was used as retail space, in 2015 was returned to the open area that Mary Colter had intended, because the room was originally designed to be a rest area. It was here that visitors to the canyon in the 1930\u2019s could sit in comfort and have outstanding views of the canyon. The fireplace is unique in that it does not block the view for visitors. Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>\u201cFirst and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.\u201d</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the\u00a0<em>\u201cweathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls\u201d.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company. Upon this framework, each exterior stone was selected and carefully placed to ensure exactly the look that Mary Colter was hoping to obtain.</p> <h3>Traveling to the Watchtower\u00a0</h3> <p><strong>Park Shuttles are NOT provided to Desert View.\u00a0You must drive you vehicle, or take a </strong><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/plan/interpretive-bus-tours/\">commercial bus tour</a>,\u00a0that starts from Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> The 23 mile (37 km) drive east of Grand Canyon Village on Arizona Highway 64 is worth the effort. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-drive.htm\">Desert View Drive</a> offers spectacular perspectives of the canyon, including:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Six developed canyon viewpoints</li> <li>Four picnic areas\u00a0</li> <li>Five unmarked pullouts\u00a0</li> <li>Accessibility for private vehicles\u00a0</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/tusayan-ruin-trail.htm\">Tusayan Pueblo Site and Museum</a> - Open Thursday through Monday</li> </ul> <p><br /> There is NO lodging at Desert View, although there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-campground.htm\">seasonal campground</a> operated by the National Park Service from mid-April to mid-October.</p> <h3>Desert View Visitor Services</h3> <p>Desert View provides restrooms, the Watchtower, Trading Post/ice cream/coffee, Grocery Store/Deli, Gas Station, and Campground. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view.htm\">Details ></a><br /> <br /> <strong>Cultural handicraft demonstrations take place in the Watchtower in the Spring, Summer and Fall.\u00a0</strong>The program provides an opportunity for visitors to interact with Tribal artisans from Grand Canyon's Traditionally Associated Tribes, and for them to share their history, knowledge and skills.\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-cultural-demonstration-program.htm\">View the Schedule ></a></em></p>",
      "audioDescription": "As you move north down a gently sloping eight-foot-wide asphalt path, a five-story, 70-foot-tall (21 m) circular stone tower sits perched on the South Rim at the left. Massive, irregularly shaped limestone foundation stones ring the bottom of its 30-foot (9 m) diameter base. Concentric rows of rough rectangular-shaped limestone bricks with weathered faces fill its tapered sides. Log posts stick out through the wall here and there. Trapezoidal-shaped picture windows appear near the top of the tower. Cracks in the walls seem to run through many smaller window openings irregularly disposed along its surface, some of which are themselves irregular in shape, all conveying a partly ruinous appearance. Inlaid in one side is a three-foot (1 m) square limestone plaque of a native snake spirit, and there is open observation area on the roof. Immediately west of the Watchtower, but separated from it by several feet, stands a stone ruin which serves as a storage facility and firewood bin. To the right is an attached one-story, 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular stone kiva, with an observation platform on its roof and large picture windows overlooking the canyon. Magnificent vistas of earth and sky are visible from the many overlooks in, on, and around the tower. Colors blend and change as the sun rises and passes toward the west. The dark night sky allows stars to slowly emerge. Feel the extreme texture in the masonry, and the careful massing of forms that add visual depth and architectural emphasis to the structure. Listen to the winds and canyon creatures all around you. Move from the asphalt sidewalk through a wood-framed doorway and into the stone kiva building onto a flat stone floor. Opposite the door on the far side of the 40-foot (12 m) diameter circular room is a six-foot (2 m) wide stone fireplace. In the center is a smaller four-foot (1.2 m) wide symbolic fire ring, two-feet (60 cm) tall, topped with a ladder to the world above. Visitors are not permitted to climb the ladder. Six eight-foot (2.4 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) tall windows ring the perimeter of the room looking out onto the canyon. Note that the 18-inch (46 cm) deep stone windowsills also serve as seating areas and benches. Notice also that along the side of some of the large windows hang three-foot (1 m) wide by four-foot (1.5 m) tall black reflector scopes in wood log frames. Originally made of highly polished black onyx, they were invented by Claude Lorrain in the 1600s to intensify the color of the image reflected in the scope that gets wiped out by very strong light. Reflecting Grand Canyon's image in the black glass makes the color seem stronger. Above the windows, logs salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel are overlaid horizontally six-feet high in a crisscrossing, cribbed formation around the circular room. Additional horizontal logs form the flat ceiling of the room. Fifteen feet (4.5 m) to the left of the door is a small Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store. Facing the store, 10 feet (3 m) to the right, a stone staircase with a leather-wrapped wooden handrail on the right curves counterclockwise up 22 steps to the first floor of the Watchtower. Note a four-foot (1.2 m) long by four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal handrail mounted to the floor at the base of the stairs that serves to separate foot traffic flowing simultaneously up and down the stairs. Note also a doorway to the left at the top of the stairs that leads out onto the flat roof and observation deck of the circular kiva building.",

Initially owned and operated by the Fred Harvey company in conjunction with the Santa Fe Railway, many considered it the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi River.<br /> <br /> In 1987, the hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located on Village Loop Drive about 100 feet (30 m) from the South Rim, the El Tovar Hotel blends a Swiss chalet and a Norwegian hunting lodge with a rustic Mission style. Five steps lead up to a broad limestone and pine entry veranda on its east side, extending 40 feet (12 m) across the front of the building. Numerous rocking chairs and benches are set out on its 10-foot (3 m) deep wooden porch. Behind the veranda, the lobby rises three stories tall, topped with an octagonal turret with a pyramid roof. A smaller wooden porch on the north side of the building faces the canyon, and is equipped with a wheelchair ramp. The hotel has many levels. The 200-foot (60 m) long two-story central portion runs roughly parallel with the canyon rim and connects to three-story north and south wings. The top floors of the guest room wings extend only partway from the central section, creating roof decks. The third floor exterior is treated as a mansard, with projecting dormers with shallow gables. The lower portions of the building are mainly of log construction, yielding to a lighter, smoother framed construction sheathed with dark wood planking on the upper levels. The roof is covered in wood shingles. Inside, the central rotunda of the lobby features Swiss-inspired cutout wood railings framed by peeled log posts, all varnished a dark brown. Southwestern pattern carpets are accented with Arts and Crafts Movement furnishings and native southwestern motifs. There are two gift stores at the left and right, and numerous mounted moose, deer, and elk heads ring the room high on the walls under exposed log timbers. Accessible restrooms are located down a hallway to the right of the check-in desk in the center of the rotunda. Keys to these facilities may be requested at the desk.To the rear of the lobby is a dining room with large windows through which one can view the canyon.",

The realization of preserving trails and historic buildings, delivering educational programs for the public, conducting scientific research, and protecting wildlife and their natural habitat has been cultivated, in part, through GCC's memberships, publications, educational outreach, park stores, philanthropic efforts, and a field institute featuring guided natural and cultural history programs.<br /> <br /> Your purchases at each GCC Park Store will support these and many other initiatives in Grand Canyon. A GCC membership provides you with a 15% discount on all purchases at any of GCC bookstores in the park. In addition, your membership may allow for separate discounts at other park\u00a0cooperating associations and stores on separate federal public lands.</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Conservancy (GCC) Stores</h3> <p><strong>GCC operates multiple Park Stores in the park:</strong><br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center<br /> Kolb Studio<br /> Tusayan Museum and Ruin<br /> Desert View Watchtower<br /> North Rim Visitor Center</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Field Institute</h3> <p>The Grand Canyon Conservancy Field Institute helps visitors experience Grand Canyon like never before. Through classes, guided hiking trips, and educational tours you will learn about the geology and cultural and natural history of this magnificent place from those who know it best-geologists, historians, ecologists, archaeologists, and other experts.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>In 1932, park ranger naturalist Edwin \"Eddie\" McKee founded the Grand Canyon Natural History Association. As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its\u00a0beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 19, North Rim Visitor Center. 5 minutes. The North Rim Visitor Center is located about 400 feet (120 meters) north of Grand Canyon Lodge along the east side of the road, at the far south end of the main lodge parking lot. Note there are two sections of several wheelchair accessible parking spaces along the bottom of this lot. This stop begins behind the Visitor Center. From a position facing south from the south end of the parking lot, straight ahead, a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) square concrete plaza fills the area in back of the Visitor Center building, off to the right. About 15 feet (four and a half meters) ahead at the left stands a 10 foot (three meter) tall stone wayside structure with open sides and a triangular log and shingle roof. About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the stone structure at the left, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. At the top center, a central L C D screen allows one to select from one of four vehicle pass options. A note to the left of the screen lists a telephone number for assistance purchasing a pass: 9 2 8, 6 3 8, 7 8 5 0. Inside the stone structure, several large information panels about the park\u2019s trails and overlooks are displayed, including several maps of the region. A description of these panels is included in the sub-script below. About six feet (two meters) to the right of the far end of the wayside structure, note a water bottle filling station atop a low, rectangular stone base with three spigots across its face. To the right of the water station, two 12-foot (three and a half meter) tall square, stone pillars support the back log and shingle roof of the Visitor Center. They frame a wide walkway to a set of restrooms inside through a pair of double, wood and glass doors. Note the men\u2019s restroom is to the left, and the women\u2019s accessible restroom is to the right. Also note a wooden bench along the walkway to the right, and a single wooden chair to the left. Embedded in the middle of the plaza, between the wayside structure and Visitor Center building, a compass rose surrounds a central brass medallion with the words, \u201cGrand Canyon National Park North Rim\u201d around its edge in all capital letters. The center of the medallion lists several statistics. It reads: Elevation above sea: 8,238 feet (2,511 meters) D M S (N A D 83): 36 degrees, 11 minutes, 54 seconds North; 112 degrees, three minutes, eight seconds West U T M (N A D 83 Zone 12 N): 4 0 5 3 9 2 E, 4 0 0 6 4 6 8 N At the far northeast end of the plaza, a small, standalone, wood plank hut with an open front houses a coin-operated soda machine at the left, and an ice machine along the back wall. To move to the Visitor Center entrance, once again from a position located at the south end of the main parking lot, turn right (east) toward the lodge loop road, and move forward about 35 feet (10 meters) down a slightly sloping sidewalk along the side of the building. Note a pair of metal, wildlife-proof garbage cans to the right back towards the lot. Just past a couple, two-tier wooden benches at the right, the sidewalk narrows, bounded by low stone boulders at the right. A few more feet forward, the sidewalk turns left to face up an inclined ramp with a log fence and railing on either side. Continue about 20 feet (six meters) up the ramp to a 15 foot wide by 10 foot deep (four and a half by three meter) wood plank porch at the front of the Visitor Center. You may enter the Visitor Center through a pair of wood and glass doors in the center of the porch at the left. On the porch to the left and right of the front doors, two, three-foot tall, angled, wooden wayside panels display information about North Rim Park Ranger programs and park announcements. Note there is a wooden bench on the far side of the porch opposite the ramp. Also note across the porch, directly opposite the front doors, a wide flight of 10 concrete stairs with a log railing on either side lead down to a sidewalk in front the Visitor Center, beside the two-lane lodge loop road. The Visitor Center houses the Grand Canyon Conservancy bookstore. It features a wide variety of books, maps, and gifts to help you plan or remember your trip to Grand Canyon, and to learn more about its geology, ecology, and history. Sub-Script Welcome Wayside Panel About five feet (one and a half meters) in front of the short, north wall of the tall stone wayside structure, a green, metal, standalone entrance permit self-pay station stands mounted to the ground. Behind the pay station, words at the top of an information panel mounted to the face of the stone wayside structure read, \u201cWelcome to Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim.\u201d A color photograph filling the bottom half of the panel shows a view of a Grand Canyon sunset at Bright Angel Point. At the center left of the panel, the first of two inset color images shows a photograph of the front porch of the Visitor Center. A list of the amenities and their icons below the photograph reads: Information and Orientation; Water; Restrooms; and Access to Grand Canyon rim and lodge. The second image at the center right shows a map of the roads around the North Rim, traced in black. The roads generally run along the top of the map, from the lodge and campground areas at the left, up and across the Kaibab and Walhalla Plateaus to the right to Point Imperial, Vista Encantada, Roosevelt Point, all the way to Cape Royal at the lower right. At the left of the image, a small, rectangular \u201cYou Are Here\u201d label sits below another label identifying the Visitor Center. Exploring the Region Wayside Panel On the inside face of the short, north, front stone wall of the wayside structure, an information panel presents a half dozen color photographs at the top and bottom of other, nearby national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. In the center of the panel is a map identifying their locations relative to Grand Canyon National Park, shown in the center of the map. From left to right at the top, there is an image of a conical, thatched hut from Pipe Spring National Monument in Arizona, the high, vertical cliff walls of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, and the dam and river below the high, curved stone walls of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona and Utah. From left to right at the bottom, there is an image of tall, stone buttresses with flat, stone tops at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, three isolated, tall stone buttes in Monument Valley Tribal Park in Arizona and Utah, and the rim of the steep, deep canyon at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. Many other sites are also shown on the map. Explore Close By Wayside Panel Sheltered in the center of the stone wayside structure, two five-foot wide by three-foot tall (one and a half by one meter) information panels mounted on angled, metal reading rails stand back-to-back. From a position facing east, with the short, north stone wall and the \u201cExploring the Region\u201d wayside at the left, a color photograph at the top left of this panel shows a canyon view along Bright Angel Trail, framed by a rocky overhang above, and a couple scraggly evergreens at the left. Text beneath the photograph reads: Explore Close By Experience the North Rim: walks along the rim, down into the canyon, and through high forests. Feel the remoteness of this high vantage point. These hikes are only a short walk of drive away. For information about more hikes, drives, and overlooks \u2013 see the other side. At the bottom left, a caption below an inset image of a small newspaper reads: The park newspaper, The Guide, contains detailed information about hikes. Available at the visitor center in Deutsch, Espa\u00f1ol, Francais, Italiano, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. A map of the immediate North Rim area fills the middle of the panel. A dark line traces the outline of the rim, a long, slender, peninsula-like shape, like Italy without the heel of the boot. At the lower left, a legend above a compass rose shows the symbols used for the roads, sidewalks, trails, and buildings on the map. Towards the bottom center, in a cluster of buildings around Grand Canyon Lodge, a couple small, rectangular labels point to the Visitor Center with the words, \u201cYou Are Here.\u201d In the center of the map is the campground, with the North Kaibab trailhead near the top. Small, numbered circles appear along four of the dotted line trails, corresponding to a photograph and short description of each trail on the right side of the panel. At the top right of the panel, the first of three descriptions shows a photograph of the canyon along the Bright Angel fault. A title reads: 1 \u2013 Bright Angel Point Trail \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Walk the short trail from the lodge to a dramatic canyon overlook. Zero point five miles (zero point eight kilometers) roundtrip 30 minute roundtrip The second of three descriptions shows a photograph of a packed dirt path winding through a stand of tall ponderosa pine. A title reads: 2 \u2013 Bridle Path \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Hike through ponderosa forests to the North Kaibab Trailhead. Two point four miles (three point nine kilometers) roundtrip. One point five hours roundtrip. Bicycles and leashed pets allowed. The third descriptions shows a photograph of a wide dirt and gravel path lined with large boulders beside a mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. A title reads: 3 \u2013 Transept Trail \u2013 Easy A caption continues: Explore the rim between the lodge and the North Rim Campground. Three miles (four point eight kilometers) roundtrip. One point five hours roundtrip. The fourth description fills the bottom right of the panel. A photograph shows a wooded area at the base of high, rock walls. A title reads: 4 \u2013 North Kaibab Trail \u2013 Moderate to Difficult A caption continues:",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 20, Grand Canyon Lodge Circle. 7 minutes. About 400 feet (120 meters) south of the Visitor Center, Route 67 reaches its southernmost end in a loop road that runs in front of a U-shaped, multiple log and stone building complex. Note a \u2018Do Not Enter\u2019 sign at the head of the loop road, as access is restricted to authorized commercial service providers, and folks entering to use the accessible parking spaces along the east near Rough Rider Saloon. Here we find Deli in the Pines to the west, Grand Canyon Lodge to the south, and Rough Rider Saloon, the Post Office, and the gift shop along the east. A stone sidewalk porch at ground level runs in front of Deli in the Pines and Grand Canyon Lodge. Note also a raised stone sidewalk porch in front the gift shop, Post Office, and Rough Rider Saloon. This porch can be accessed from a set of stone stairs at the north and south ends of the porch, or via an access ramp that begins just north of the gift shop at ground level. From here, the ramp leads about 60 feet (18 meters) east up a slight incline, then turns right to continue 100 feet (30 meters) south along the back of the building. Turning right again, the ramp continues up a slight incline with metal handrails at the left and center, then through a covered, stone hallway to arrive at the south end of the raised sidewalk porch, with Rough Rider Saloon at the right. The loop road surrounds an oval landscaped area in its center. Towards the southern end of the oval, a metal flagpole stands before a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail. A rough, stone sidewalk spans the 40 foot (12 meter) width of the oval in front of the wayside. Should you move to the wayside, be mindful of any vehicular traffic when crossing the loop road. Entitled, \u201cGrand Canyon Lodge,\u201d the panel tells of the need for and construction of the lodge. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. A wide, covered, flat stone sidewalk porch runs around the front of all the buildings, supported by large stone columns and wide wooden posts, spaced about every eight to ten feet (two-and-a-half to three meters) along the roofline at the edge of the sidewalk. Beginning at the far, northwest side of the complex, a set of restrooms is located up a couple wide, stone steps from the loop road, through a single wooden door. The men\u2019s restroom is to the left; the women\u2019s restroom is to the right. From the restrooms, move about 50 feet (15 meters) south along the porch to the two side-by-side glass and metal doors of Deli in the Pines at the right. Coffee drinks are available daily, in addition to grab-and-go sandwiches, pizza, soup or chili, and snacks. Grab-and-go food menu items and beverages are available daily. Note there may be a two-tier wooden bench outside the deli doors at the edge of the sidewalk. From Deli in the Pines, continue south along the porch another 40 feet (12 meters), then turn left about 50 feet (15 meters) to the main entrance to Grand Canyon Lodge at the right. To the right of the doors, note a water fountain with a bottle filling spigot mounted on the outside wall of the lodge. Also note a wildlife-proof, metal garbage on the other side of the porch, immediately opposite the water fountain. The lodge features private cabins, both along and near the rim of Grand Canyon in the forest. Interior wheelchair lifts allow access to the auditorium and dining room. The dining room serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. Note reservations are required for dinner. At the back of the lodge, two large, stone patios with wooden deck chairs afford unobstructed views of the canyon. A third interior wheelchair lift allows access to the patio level. Note also several narrow, uneven stone staircases and paths that lead down from the patio to the Bright Angel Point Trail along the base of the lodge. From the front doors of the lodge, the porch continues about 50 feet (15 meters) east past a long line of large, rough-hewn, wooden deck chairs placed along the outside stone wall at the right. A 15-foot (three meter) wide stone staircase, with a metal handrail at each side and another in the middle, leads up nine steps to the stone porch area in front of Rough Rider Saloon. Whether you arrive at this location via the stairs or the access ramp, here at the southern end of the stone porch, white, arched lettering across the top of a six-foot (two meter) square plate glass window spells, \u201cSaloon.\u201d Guests are invited to stop in for a quick cappuccino, espresso, or coffee in the morning. Baked goods and breakfast burritos are also available from 5:30 to 10:30 am. In the afternoon, from 11 am to 11 pm, cold beverages and pizza slices are available while the saloon transitions to evening dinner options and a bar. About six feet (two meters) north along the porch from the saloon is the Post Office. Vertical metal bars cover the face of a double-hung window in the log wall, with a small open slot at the bottom center. At the top left side of the window, white letters carved into the first of two, small wooden signs sticking out from the building read, \u201cPost Office.\u201d The second reads, \u201cN Rim A Z, 8 6 0 5 2.\u201d Beneath the window, a word above a horizontal slot at the top of a plain, painted, brown wooden panel reads, \u201cLetters.\u201d About six feet (two meters) to the left (north) of the window, note a sturdy, three foot (one meter) tall wooden writing desk juts out from the wall about two feet (60 centimeters). A second, narrow wooden shelf is mounted to the wall slightly above it. Note also a garbage can on the porch, placed just to the left of the desk. The Post Office is an active operation that handles post cards and letters for residents and visitors to Grand Canyon's North Rim. It is open Monday through Friday during the season between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm, and from 1 pm to 5 pm At the far northern end of the raised, stone porch is the door to the gift shop. The shop offers visitors to the North Rim gifts, postcards, and souvenirs of their trip, from clothing and accessories to Native Americans handicrafts. Sub-Script Grand Canyon Lodge Wayside Panel A sepia-tone photograph fills the left side of the panel. In front a line of buses arrayed in front of Grand Canyon Lodge, a line of men and women stand a couple rows deep, all dressed in light-colored, one-piece dresses or white shirts with dark pants. Two of the men hold a banjo and guitar. A caption reads: Lodge employees, in 1930, \u201csing away\u201d departing guests in front of the first Grand Canyon Lodge. Entitled, \u201cGrand Canyon Lodge,\u201d text at the top of the panel reads: When Grand Canyon became a national park in 1919, the North Rim was scarcely developed. While the South Rim had grand hotels and many visitor programs and services, the hard-to-reach North Rim had only rustic tent cabins for 40 guests. The National Park Service\u2019s first Director, Stephen T. Mather, urged the Union Pacific Railroad to improve access to the North Rim and build a rustic lodge with cabins. During 1927\u20131928, architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed and built a lodge using local Kaibab Limestone and ponderosa pine logs taken from the site. Just four years after completion, the new lodge and four cabins burned to the ground. At the top right, a caption above a color inset drawing of the lodge reads: Architect Underwood\u2019s rendering of the original lodge shows its second story level and a three-story observation tower, both eliminated in the lodge\u2019s reconstruction in 1937. A quote above the rendering reads: So cunningly have the architects planned this remarkable building that it seems to have sprung full-grown from the canyon wall itself. \u2014Union Pacific Railroad, 1929 At the bottom right, a black-and-white picture shows a roofless, burned-out lodge, with blackened stone walls. A caption reads: On September 1, 1932, fire left only the foundations and walls of the first lodge. The present-day lodge, rebuilt on the old foundation, features more stone and less timber to make it more fire resistant. The steeper roof sheds snow more efficiently.",

      "audioDescription": "The Grand Canyon Visitor Center shuttle bus terminal is located on the southeast side of Grand Canyon Visitor Center Plaza in a large, open-air gazebo filled with many benches. A large analog clock with no hands hangs in the middle of the gazebo, with overhead signs pointing to the Bookstore, Canyon Rim, and the shuttle bus stops themselves. The bus stops and bus turnarounds are located to the east outside the gazebo across a one-lane asphalt road. Be mindful of bus traffic as you move to this area. Free shuttle buses operate on four routes at Grand Canyon National Park: Hermits Rest Route (indicated in red on the map), Village Route (blue), Kaibab/Rim Route (orange), and Tusayan [TWO-see-ahn] Route (purple). The shuttles are free, no tickets are required, and bus stops are clearly marked here at the terminal and throughout the park by signs along with their matching color. Buses are white with a green stripe. The route name is indicated on the front of the bus. Note that the Hermits Rest Route is not in service between December 1 and February 28. During those three months only, Hermit Road is open to private vehicles. Note also that the Tusayan Route operates during summer only. Exact dates are announced each winter prior to the shuttle's operation. A scenic drive accessibility permit is available at all entrance stations, visitor centers, hotels, and the Backcountry Information Center. The permit allows access to some areas closed to the general-public traffic. Shuttle buses are equipped with ramps to accommodate wheelchairs smaller than 30 inches wide by 48 inches long (76 by 122 cm). Most motorized scooters will not fit on shuttle buses. Note that food, drinks, and pets are not permitted on shuttle buses, but service animals for visitors with disabilities are allowed.",

Text at the top of the panel reads: \"Grand Canyon's rocks are incredibly old. Grand Canyon's oldest known rock is called the Elves Chasm Gneiss (pronounced \"NICE\") and it is 1,840 million years old.\" On the left of the panel, a caption under a color photograph looking out towards Maricopa Point from your present location reads: \"Imagine how old? The 1,840 million-year-old Elves Chasm Gneiss is almost unimaginably old, yet it is only two-fifths the age of the Earth. To reach the 4,560 million-year age of the Earth along the Trail of Time, walk west 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles), to Maricopa Point.\" A graphic in the center of the panel shows a central cluster of blue and red circles being orbited by five black circles along separate elliptical lines. A caption reads: \"How do we know? Geologists can tell how old a rock is by counting the atoms produced by natural radioactive decay.\" Referring to the rock sample at your right, text on the right side of the panel continues: \"Touch a rock that is 1,840 million years old. This rock sample came from the bottom of the canyon 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of here.\" Next to a color photograph showing a layer of similar rock beside the Colorado riverbed, a caption reads: \"This rock was first formed as granite when magma cooled 1,840 million years ago. Pressure and heat then changed it into gneiss (pronounced NICE) about 1,700 million years ago.\" A map of the Trail of Time runs along the bottom of the panel. Text below the map reads: \"You are on a timeline. 1 long step = 1 million years.\" A graphic of the V-shaped Trail of Time portal rock column at the bottom right asks, \"Where in the rock record?\" An arrow points just above the bottom of the column with the label, \"1,840 million years ago.\"",

It also provides especially fantastic aerial views of the switchbacks on the upper and middle portions of Bright Angel Trail, as well as a view of 3-Mile Resthouse far below. Grandeur Point is a\u00a0popular stop along the Rim Trail between Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village, as well as\u00a0a popular spot for sunset that is often less crowded and\u00a0more easily accessible spots like Mather, Lipan,\u00a0or Hopi Points.<br /> <br /> Grandeur Point is located along the Rim Trail about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of Yavapai Point and Yavapai Geology Museum. It can also be reached via Parking Lot A and Park Headquarters by following the paved trail past McKee Amphitheater and out to the Rim Trail. After following this path for 0.4 miles (0.6 km), turn right and follow the Rim Trail east for nearly 0.5 miles (0.8 km). The view is worth the walk!</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Grandeur Point offers an especially dramatic view of Bright Angel Canyon, which slices directly across Grand Canyon and cuts deep into both the South and North Rims. Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and\u00a0small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear\u00a0cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago. Since its initial formation, the Bright Angel Fault has been reactivated several times, sometimes as a normal fault (such as it is now) and sometimes as a reverse and/or strike-slip fault.<br /> \u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A flat wooden bench sits in a paved pull-out just off a paved trail following edge of Grand Canyon. Beyond the bench a wall of large rough white rocks about 3 feet highlines the edge of the path.

It is located along Desert View Drive (SR 64), halfway between Grand Canyon Village (10.2 miles/16.4 K) and Desert View (13.8 miles/22.2 K). The viewpoint offers breathtaking panoramic views of the canyon and is known for stunning sunrises and sunsets.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:\u00a0</strong><br /> Elevation: Grandview Point is approximately 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) above sea level, making it one of the highest points along the South Rim.\u00a0From Grandview Point, travelers can see vast expanses of the canyon, including the Colorado River and the layers of colorful rock strata that reveal the geological history of the area.</p> <p><strong>Visitor Facilities:</strong><br /> At the overlook, there are parking areas and vault toilets available. Drinking water is not available.</p> <p><strong>Safety Considerations:\u00a0</strong><br /> Due to its elevation and the rugged terrain, visitors should wear appropriate footwear and be cautious near the canyon\u2019s edge.</p> <p><strong>Historic Trail:</strong><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/grandview-trail.htm\">Grandview Trail</a> starts here at the scenic overlook and plunges steeply into the canyon. Originally constructed in the late 1800s, this trail served mining operations, enabling the transport of copper ore using burros and mules.<br /> <br /> Today the trail is popular with hikers looking for a more rugged experience. <strong>Trail Difficulty: Hard/Strenous.\u00a0</strong><br /> <br /> During summer, much of the trail is in full sun. In winter, ice and snow make hiking treacherous. Always use caution on the Grandview Trail and consult a park ranger at one of the visitor centers or the Backcountry Information Center for the latest weather and trail conditions.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A two-foot (60 cm) tall limestone wall lines the north side of an asphalt sidewalk next to the loop road. A five-foot (1.5 m) wide opening in the wall leads from the road about 100 feet (30 m) down a paved, gently sloping sidewalk to the overlook. Note that opposite this opening, a crosswalk across the road leads to a set of vault toilets in a wooded area of oak, ponderosa and pinyon pine in the middle of the loop.<br />Just before the overlook, there is a 20-foot wide by 10-foot (3 m) deep oval garden area ringed with low limestone rocks. Continue around the garden on either side to a three-foot (1 m) tall curved limestone wall, 40-feet (12 m) across.<br />At the eastern end of the overlook, a vintage panoramic photograph of Horseshoe Mesa fills a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top reads:<br />\"Last Chance Mine<br />If a horseshoe can bring luck, why not a horseshoe-shaped mesa? Some 2,500 feet (760 m) below you sits Horseshoe Mesa. There, in 1890, Pete Berry and fellow miners discovered copper and began digging the Last Chance Mine. The ore was rich (15 to 30 percent pure copper), but like all Grand Canyon mines, the amount of ore was small. Berry created other opportunities to make money. In 1897, he built the Grandview Hotel near here, and adventuresome tourists mingled with the miners on Horseshoe Mesa. But, when the railroad came to the Grand Canyon in 1901, its depot was 14 miles away from Berry's hotel. In 1907, copper prices crashed. Luck had changed for Pete and his wife Martha, so in 1919 they left, moving to their son's ranch outside the park.\"<br />A black-and-white photograph at the left center shows men and mules on a steep switchback trail buttressed with logs and rocks. A caption reads:<br />\"Berry and his crew built a 3-mile (5 km) long trail to the mine, which was one of the finest constructed trails in Grand Canyon during the pioneer period. Today it is a rough, steep route for well-prepared hikers.\"<br />In the center, a second photograph shows about 10 miners standing in front of a dining hall and bunkhouse on the mesa, while a third photograph at the right shows heavily-laden mules on a steep, rocky trail. A caption reads:<br />\"Mules and burros carried 200-pound (90 kg) loads of copper ore up the trail. From Grandview Point the ore had to be shipped to El Paso, Texas, a serious limit on mining profits.<br />The Last Chance Mine operation on Horseshoe Mesa, early 1900.\"",

Shaped and built like a Hopi pueblo, Hopi House was originally designed to house the main sales rooms for Fred Harvey Indian Arts. Mary Colter designed the building to resemble a Hopi dwelling similar to those at Oraibi, Arizona. In its early years, Hopi House was an actual dwelling-some of the Hopis who worked in the building lived on the upper floors.<br /> <br /> Hopi House is rectangular and its multiple roofs are stepped at various levels, giving the impression of Puebloan architecture. The sandstone walls are reddish in color, and tiny windows, like those of true Hopi structures, allow only the smallest amount of light into the building.<br /> <br /> Inside, the floor finish on the first story is concrete. Most of the rooms have a ceiling typical of the Hopi style: saplings, grasses, and twigs with a mud coating on top, resting on peeled log beams. Corner fireplaces, small niches in the walls, and a mud-plaster wall finish, typical of Hopi interiors, are also character-defining features.</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located opposite the El Tovar hotel on the other side of the large circular driveway, Hopi House is a three-story stepped stone masonry structure with sandstone walls with parapets. Mary Colter designed Hopi House to blend into the neighboring environment, using local natural materials such as sandstone and juniper modeled after Hopi pueblo dwellings. The flat roof surfaces function as terraces. Small openings with wood sash windows and low ceilings minimize the harsh desert sunlight. Chimneys are made from broken pottery jars stacked and mortared together. An old staircase leading to the second floor is decorated with murals by an unknown Hopi artist. Inside, the interior limestone walls are plastered with adobe, and the ceilings are composed of saplings, twigs and grass covered with mud. An 18-inch (46 cm) square metal plaque mounted flat to the top of a four-foot (1.2 m) tall rectangular limestone pedestal, located about 50 feet (15 m) west of Hopi House off Village Loop Drive, reads: Hopi House has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America, 1987, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior. At the west entrance to Hopi House, a low wooden door opens onto gently declining wood floors. Inside, the walls are lined with display cases filled with various native arts and crafts available for purchase, alongside tables and racks of clothing and Navajo rugs. Move 18 steps up an interior staircase to a small gallery on the second floor. The second floor also houses a shrine, called a kiva, with replicas of Hopi religious artifacts.",

Hopi House opened to the public in 1905. In an era when most architects were men, it was Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter's first building. The 36-year-old Colter enlisted the help of local Hopi craftsmen to build Hopi House, using locally quarried stone and wood harvested from the nearby forest. Hopi House was not just a curio store, it was also a place from where American Indian artisans lived and worked. Under the watchful eyes of visitors, these artisans would create beautiful jewelry, pottery, blankets, and other items that would then be sold at Hopi House, forging a personal connection to the items visitors purchased there.\" A quote at the top from Virginia Grattan's 1992 book, \"Mary Colter: Builder Upon the Red Earth,\" reads: \"For Mary Colter, Hopi House was an opportunity to re-create the distinctive dwelling of an ancient culture and to acquaint the public with the richness and beauty of Native American art.\" The first of two inset black-and-white photographs at the bottom right shows a Hopi village filled with similar stone buildings and terraces with the caption: \"Colter modeled Hopi House after centuries-old villages on the Hopi Reservation.\" At the bottom right, a second photograph shows a half-dozen men and women with their wares seated on an elaborate rug in front of Hopi House with the caption: \"Hopi artisans and their families, in exchange for their artwork and demonstrations, received wages and lodging at Hopi House. Today, various tribes demonstrate traditional dance and art, but they are no longer housed here.\" On the right panel, an old black-and-white photograph shows about 15 well-dressed visitors standing on the El Tovar veranda with a black convertible motorcar parked out front. Text at the top left reads: \"El Tovar Hotel. The El Tovar Hotel was a game changer. Prior to its construction most Grand Canyon visitors slept in tent accommodations on the South Rim. Opening to great fanfare on January 14, 1905, the hotel catered to a wealthy clientele. Imagine guests' delight upon finding a music room, a solarium, a billiard hall, an underground grotto (where men enjoyed a friendly game of cards), a barbershop, two roof gardens, an art room, and gift shop. For $4.50 and upwards per night, guests were treated to finely decorated rooms with both hot and cold running water.\" Text to the right of the photograph reads: \"Keeping with the Santa Fe Railway's affinity for naming their hotels after Spanish explorers, \"El Tovar\" honored Don Pedro de Tovar, who visited the Hopi mesas to the east in 1540.\" A quote from the Coconino Sun from May 24, 1902 at the top right reads: \"The Santa Fe is going to build the most expensive hotel...at the Grand Canyon...the idea of the architect is to bring the building into harmony with the wonderful scenery of the canyon rather than to put a blot upon its beauty by the erection of a conventional structure.\" A second black-and-white photograph inset at the bottom right shows the interior of one of the rooms with two wooden sleigh beds, a couple rocking chairs, a large dresser topped with a mirror, and a smaller vanity. A caption reads: \"Early 20th century visitors enjoyed the comforts and luxuries of the El Tovar.\"",

His father was a manager at Phantom Ranch, and Ken had the luxury of growing up a world wonder and exploring as much of it as possible.<br /> <br /> In his twenties, he began a career that started in Grand Canyon, followed by the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, and Point Reyes National Seashore.<br /> <br /> On the morning of August 5, 1973, Ken approached three individuals while on duty at Point Reyes. One of them fired shots at the park ranger, who was found dead at the scene by a colleague later that day. His gun was holstered and concealed under his uniform jacket. The individuals, apparently members of The Black Panther organization, were later apprehended and convicted on evidence of deer poaching, stolen checks, drug possession, and the murder of Ken Patrick.<br /> <br /> Ken Patrick was laid to rest at the South Rim in Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery on August 9, 1973.</p>",

By October 1902, he had persuaded his brother Emery to join him. A year later, the brothers established their photography business near Bright Angel Trailhead after receiving permission from Ralph Cameron, who at the time owned Bright Angel Trail. They camped out in a small tent on the canyon rim before building a small wooden house in 1906, which they called Kolb Studio.<br /> <br /> Over the next 12 years, the Kolb brothers established themselves as both photographers and adventurers. From capturing unorthodox photos of hard-to-reach areas of the canyon to documenting their 101 days running the Colorado River on film with a motion-picture camera, Ellsworth and Emery revealed images that few had dreamed of. Selling their images in leather-bound books for three dollars each and touring the country to present their film lecture series, the Kolb brothers made a name for themselves and opened the eyes of a nation to this wonder of the world.<br /> <br /> For decades, the Kolb brothers continued to make a living out of Kolb Studio on Grand Canyon's South Rim. Later in life, when their contractual agreements with the park ended, the National Park Service actually wanted to demolish this studio in the 1960s. The architecture wasn't quite in line with the style and theme of other buildings in the park. After several years of quibbling between Emery and the agency, the structure was saved when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, legislation that effectively protected park structures over 50 years old from being destroyed.</p> <h3>Tour the Private Residence</h3> <p><strong>Enter the little seen depths of this\u00a0five-story building for a\u00a0behind the scenes tour of the Kolb family's\u00a0private home and photography studio.\u00a0</strong></p> <ul> <li>Your guide\u00a0will weave\u00a0stories of the Kolb\u00a0family members.<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><strong>Days Offered:</strong> Tuesday,\u00a0Wednesday and Friday</li> <li><strong>Time</strong>: 1 pm\u00a0| 60 minutes (one hour)\u00a0</li> <li> <p><strong>Participant\u00a0Size:</strong>\u00a08</p> </li> <li><strong>Meet Location</strong>:\u00a0Gallery downstairs\u00a0(access is through the store).<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/experience-grand-canyon/guided-tours/kolb-studio-tour\">Additional\u00a0information about the tour</a>\u00a0\u00a0</li> <li><strong>Price:</strong>\u00a0$30/person\u00a0| <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/reservations?%2Freserve%2Ftt3-kolb-studio\">Register online</a></li> </ul>",

This makes it an ideal spot to enjoy sunrise, sunset, and the night sky.<br /> <br /> On a clear day, you can see the Vermillion Cliffs 45 miles (72 km) to the northeast and the curving river to the west as it enters the Inner Gorge of the canyon.<br /> <br /> This spacious panoramic view features many spires, buttes, and temple formations that resemble ancient pyramids. Westward views seem to stretch on forever, and the canyon walls present a tapestry of blacks, grays, reds, browns, and tans in a wide variety of rough and smooth textures.<br /> <br /> From here, you can look down to the very bottom of the canyon to view the mighty Colorado River and the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. These unique rocks are exposed in just a few places within the canyon, and are visible at only a few viewpoints. Hidden among the titled layers and cradled by the river is Unkar Delta, where ancient Puebloan people once cultivated beans, corn, and squash.<br /> <br /> Listen for the roar of Hance Rapid, almost four miles (6.4 km) away, and for the cries of hawks and other raptors along this important migration route. Forests on this side of the canyon and on the North Rim, just eight miles (13 km) away, make Lipan Point an ideal spot for birds crossing the canyon.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h4>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h4> <p>The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> In this part of the canyon, instead of being confined by the hard Vishnu basement rocks within the narrow Inner Gorge to the west, the Colorado River instead winds its way through layers of soft, purple sandstone belonging to the Dox Formation. This is why Lipan Point features such spectacular views of the river. Above these purple layers is the black Cardenas Basalt, formed by lava flows erupting due to continental collisions during the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia over one billion years ago. To the west, one can see another stretch of river cutting down through layers of purple, orange, and brown rocks; these are the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, and Shinumo Sandstone, respectively. One can also see where the river crosses from these layers into the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks underneath to begin forming the Inner Gorge.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Lipan Point is located just west of Navajo Point and the Watchtower at Desert View Point. Lipan Point features some of the widest views of the canyon and boasts the longest stretches of views of the Colorado River versus any other point along the South Rim. On a clear day, you can see the Vermillion Cliffs 45 miles (72 km) off to the northeast and the curving river as it enters the inner gorge of the canyon to the west. From the parking area, move 25 feet (8 m) north down a four-foot (1.2 m) wide gently sloping asphalt path lined with limestone rocks to a set of two concrete steps. Move down the steps to an asphalt path along the edge of the rim, lined with four-foot (1.2 m) high metal railings. The spacious panorama ahead features many spires, buttes, and temple formations that resemble ancient pyramids. Westward views seem to stretch outward forever, and the canyon walls present a tapestry of blacks, greys, reds, browns, and tans in wide variety of rough and smooth textures. Listen for the roar of some of the most formidable whitewater rapids of the Colorado River, Hance Rapids, almost four miles away. Also far below the rim, cradled by the river, is the Unkar Delta, where ancient Puebloan people once cultivated beans, corn, and squash. Listen also for the cries of hawks and other raptors along this important fall migration route. Forests on this side of the canyon and on the North Rim, here only eight miles (13 km) away, make Lipan Point an ideal spot for birds crossing the canyon.",

      "bodyText": "<h4><span>Hours of Operation</span></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>CLOSED for refurbishment (will reopen February 2026)</strong></span></p> <p><br /> Designed in 1914, Lookout Studio was architect Mary\u00a0Colter's vision to create opportunities for visitors to safely view and photograph the natural beauty of Grand Canyon from its edge. Just west of El Tovar Hotel, \"The Lookout\" is a neat, comfortable, and rustic studio of stone and log timbers. For many years, Lookout Studio served as a community gathering place, where locals and visitors alike would sit around the fire, swap stories, and use telescopes to watch mule riders on the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> Today it serves as a gift and souvenir shop and viewpoint, with several terraces that allow visitors to absorb the power and scale of the canyon from uniquely safe perspectives.</p> <h4>History and Architecture</h4> <p>This native stone structure, originally known as \"the Lookout,\" is built right into the canyon rim and appears to almost be growing organically from\u00a0it. Generally rectangular in plan, the small building is constructed of coursed rubble masonry.<br /> <br /> Commissioned to directly compete with the Kolb brothers and Kolb Studio, Mary Colter designed Lookout Studio in a similar manner as Hopi House: to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. Inspired by the natural forms of the landscape around the site, she used these influences to guide her design.<br /> <br /> The parapet rooflines and stone chimneys mimic the irregular shapes of surrounding bedrock. The interior of the building is divided into several levels, with structural log work exposed in posts, beams, and ceiling joists. The floor is scored concrete and the interior walls are exposed stone. Because of all of the viewing windows around the walls of the structure (which naturally feature Colter's trademark baby blue window frames), the interior is considerably lighter than most of Colter's other buildings.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "This two-story stone building, approximately 40- by 50-feet (12- by 15-meters) square, is perched on the edge of Grand Canyon. Through its use of local stone and wood, the building emulates the natural scenery along the rim and appears to rise from the rock around it. The walls in front rise to an irregular stone parapet, incorporating the building's chimneys. Inside, a main level houses a gift shop selling photographic prints, rock specimens, and books under a low pitch shed roof with log rafters. With its banks of large windows, Lookout Studio affords outstanding views from all floors and receives a great deal of light. The Bright Angel Trail can be seen from here. Condors often soar up and down the cliffs in the summer, using the warmed afternoon winds to cruise along the canyon. A wooden staircase at the back left of the shop leads up nine steps to a three-foot (1 m) wide landing through a wood and glass door onto an open wooden balcony. A second set of stairs at the right leads down seven steps across a six-foot (2 m) square landing through a wood and glass door onto an open outdoor stone terrace. High-powered telescopes are available at both viewing areas. Two additional outdoor observation areas sit below this first terrace. Facing back toward the door, these are accessed via a narrow stone staircase at the back left of the terrace. With the metal railing on your left, move down nine steps to a small landing and turn left. Follow along the metal railing on your right and turn left down 12 steps to an uneven rocky platform, five-feet (1.5 m) wide by 20-feet (6 m) long. Following the right-hand wall, move forward about eight feet (2.4 m) to another stone staircase, and move down nine steps to the lowest terrace. As you follow along the three-foot (1 m) high rock wall on your right, mind your footing on the rocky, uneven, four-foot (1.2 m) wide path. The canyon drops off immediately on the other side of the wall.",

The Fred Harvey Company and the Santa Fe Railroad constructed the original \"Motor Lodge\" here in 1927. Traveling by automobile to the parks was quickly becoming fashionable. Rather than having to travel by train or carriage, people could journey in their own automobiles.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s, 36 cabins were added and 22 cabins were moved from Bright Angel Lodge. Many of the 120 cabins were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by more contemporary two-story hotel rooms in 1968. The only architectural component remaining from historic lodge buildings are the original stone pillars.</p>",

Nestled in a ponderosa pine forest, Maswik Lodge features a cafeteria, pizza pub, gift shop, and a tours and activities desk. Moving through the front door from the wide concrete patio, a 20-foot (6 m) long blond wood registration desk fills the left side of the foyer. A concierge services desk opposite the registration desk sits just outside the doorway to a gift shop at the right. Moving beyond the desks, there is a men's restroom to the left, and a women's restroom to the right. There is a large cafeteria straight ahead at the back of the building, and the pizza pub is located around the corner to the left of the cafeteria.",

A wealthy\u00a0businessman from Chicago, Mather was avid conservationist and supporter of public lands,\u00a0who moved to Washington D.C. in 1915 to help found the National Park Service.\u00a0Appointed its first director\u00a0in 1917 he continued to promote park access, development, and use until he left office in 1929.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Mather believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives. During his tenure the Park Service grew to include sites such as Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains,\u00a0Mammoth Cave National Parks, and many others.<br /> <br /> He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good that he has done.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located about 1800 feet (550 m) northeast from the visitor center along a wide, smooth concrete path is Mather Point. The viewing area here is quite extensive with two major overlooks, each lined with four-foot (1.2 m) high metal safety railings built into the rocks that project out into the canyon. A plaque honoring Stephen Mather sits at the top right of a 20-foot (6 m) wide set of concrete stairs that lead down to the main overlook area. Note there is also a ramp down to the overlook located about 140 feet (42 m) west of the stairs. Following along the right handrail, move down 6 steps to a concrete landing. Continue eight feet (2.4 m) forward, moving to the right of a central limestone boulder in the center of the path to your left. Move eight steps down to a second landing, and continue 15 feet (4.5 m) forward to a central staircase. Move down 10 more steps to a third landing, and continue 20 feet (6 m) along the right-hand railing to a final set of steps. Move down seven steps to the landing at the point itself past a low, rocky platform to your left. Move all around the point, following along the railing. The powerful Colorado River snakes far below at the bottom of a one mile (1600 m) deep abyss. Colorful rock layers fill the cliffs all around you, including the tan Kaibab Formation, white and creamy Coconino Sandstone, red to orange Hermit Shale and Supai Formation, and dark gray to black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom. The panorama at Mather Point spans from Bright Angel Trail in the west to the South Kaibab Trail in the east. In between is the deep canyon of Pipe Creek, Cedar Ridge, and O'Neill Butte. The Tonto Trail is also visible. The North Rim stands 10 miles (16 km) away across the chasm. Back up on the rim, the railing continues in both directions from the point offering various other viewpoints. To the west, the Rim Trail offers more vistas all the way to Yavapai Point.",

Located just off the\u00a0connector trail\u00a0between the Canyon Rim Trail and Park Headquarters, McKee features bench seating in an open-air amphitheater. The current schedule of ranger programs is available at the Visitor Center\u00a0and on signs throughout the village.\u00a0<br /> <br /> You can also check the <strong>CALENDAR</strong> on\u00a0Grand Canyon National Park's website, or on the NPS Mobile App, for the schedule. Programs are not presented\u00a0every night.</p> <h4>What's in a Name?</h4> <p>McKee Amphitheater is named after Park Naturalist Edwin Dinwiddie McKee. Hired to work at Grand Canyon in 1929 Eddie McKee established ranger led programs\u00a0along the canyon rims, installed interpretive signs and displays, wrote educational pamphlets, and helped to establish the first version of Grand Canyon's research library and the non-profit that continues\u00a0to\u00a0support park operations to this day.\u00a0Trained as a geologist he authored numerous scientific papers on Grand Canyon rocks and strata as well as the canyon's natural resources. Working at the canyon until 1940 Eddie McKee helped to lay the frame work for modern Interpretation of Grand Canyon resources and greatly expanded the collective\u00a0knowledge of both the ancient environments and conditions that formed Grand Canyon's rock layers as well as the forces and processes necessary to carve the vast canyon we see today.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Located just a few minutes' walk from the Rim Trail, near the Shrine of the Ages, McKee Amphitheater features three sections of about 25 wooden benches each on a gently-sloping asphalt-paved surface with aisles between each section. The seats face a small raised concrete stage in front of a small wooden building housing a 10-foot (3 m) square rear-projection screen. At the front right of the amphitheater is a six-foot (2 m) diameter firepit just off of the stage, surrounded by a low, 15-inch (38 cm) tall limestone ring. McKee Amphitheater is used for educational and evening programs at Grand Canyon National Park during the warmer summer months and can accommodate approximately 500 people.",

      "bodyText": "<p>This viewpoint is named for Thomas Moran, an artist well known for his landscape paintings of the western United States. His work helped to create many national parks. Explore this point for a good spot to watch the shadows and changing light throughout the day, just as the artist did.</p> <h3>Thomas Moran</h3> <p>In 1873, Hudson River School artist Thomas Moran joined John Wesley Powell on his exploratory expeditions of Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau. Shortly after his return, Moran set to work on a canvas equal in size and ambition to his earlier 1872 painting from Yellowstone National Park, \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\". In 1874, Congress purchased the result, \"The Chasm of the Colorado\" (1873-1874, National Museum of American Art) for $10,000. It became the second of Moran's western landscapes to hang in the United States Capitol, and is now part of the Smithsonian Institution, residing primarily at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p> <h3>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h3> <p>Geology is a prominent feature at any Grand Canyon viewpoint, but especially so at Moran Point. From here, all three main rock groups of Grand Canyon are clearly visible.<br /> <br /> The horizontal sedimentary layers of rock that make up the majority of what we see in Grand Canyon's depths are known as the Layered Paleozoic Rocks. Beneath these relatively flat-lying layers are the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, which represent a significant portion of the canyon's geologic record even though they are only exposed in a few isolated sections of the canyon. These tilted layers are only visible from a few select viewpoints along the rim, including here at Moran Point. The black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite, as well as a few other associated metamorphic and igneous rocks are collectively known as the Vishnu basement rocks. These are the oldest rocks in the canyon, and thus are found far below near the Colorado River, beneath the over-lying sedimentary layers.<br /> <br /> The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> From Moran Point, one can observe prominent tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup directly to the north, sitting on the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks to the west. The short segment of the Colorado River visible here is cutting through a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, with tall cliffs of brown Shinumo Sandstone above. These vibrant orange layers of rock can also be seen on this side of the river, directly below the viewpoint to the northwest. Beyond these layers, on the far side of the canyon, one can observe four distinct layers of rock sitting on the Vishnu basement rocks. In order, these are a sill of black Cardenas Basalt, purple layers of Bass Formation, a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, and brown cliffs of Shinumo Sandstone.</p>",

Continue about a tenth of a mile (160 meters) along Admin Loop Road, then make a left to come to the parking lot of a one-story wood building, the Backcountry Information Center. A row of parallel car spaces faces a four-foot wide concrete sidewalk, with a wheelchair accessible spot at the north end. There are three larger RV parking spaces along the west side of the lot. Note at the north end of the sidewalk is another short sidewalk that leads to a water filling station. Set atop a low, rectangular stone base, an image of a rock wall in Grand Canyon fills the front of a four foot (one and half meter) square metal panel, with three water spigots protruding from its face. Note this is the only water station in the park that is open all year round, with one spigot that's operational on the kiosk, and a spigot with a red handle several feet to the right of the panel as well. In front of the building, two diagonal sidewalks leading from the parking area surround a small dirt and gravel area with a tall, metal flagpole in the center. The sidewalks converge under a large, covered outdoor patio. To the left is a large customer service window with a wooden sign above that reads, \u201cBackcountry Reservations,\u201d with a small National Park Service arrowhead logo. The Center provides information, permits, and trip planning assistance for those looking to explore Grand Canyon on day and overnight hikes from the canyon's northern rim. Day hikes do not require permits of any kind, but any overnight trip to the backcountry, whether below the rim or above, requires a permit. You can get information and try for a day-of permit in person here. A large scale hangs to the immediate left of the window. It has a metal pointer set in front of its large, circular face, and a large metal hook below. Numbers around the circumference range from zero to 100 kilograms (zero to 220 pounds). A few feet further along to the right of the reservation window are a set of double metal and glass doors. Outside, beyond the doors, note a free-standing bulletin board at the far end of the walkway in the corner with current information about park conditions. To the right of the bulletin board, note a single door to a gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 12, North Rim Entrance Station. 2 minutes. The entrance to the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park is located nearly 13 miles (21 kilometers) north of Grand Canyon Lodge on Highway 67. A few hundred feet (120 meters) north of the entrance station along the west side of the road, massive, eight foot (nearly three meter) tall, thick, round posts rise from a mound of large boulders; a third, horizontal wooden post spans the distance between them. A six foot wide by four foot tall (two by one and a half meter) wooden sign hangs suspended from wide, black metal bands wrapped around the top post. White carved lettering on the sign reads: \u201cEntering Grand Canyon National Park, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.\u201d A three-foot (one meter) tall National Park Service arrowhead logo emblazons the front of a wooden post to the right of the sign. About 10 feet (three meters) in front of the sign, lettering on a metal plaque embedded in a large boulder on the ground announces Grand Canyon National Park is a World Heritage Site. The park is open daily, from May 15th to October 15th. If you arrive when park rangers are not at the entrance station, and you are not a pass holder, please proceed to the automated fee station next to the North Rim Visitor Center. From November 1st to December 1st, the North Rim is open for \"dawn to dusk\" day use with limited services. However, if snow closes Highway 67 before December 1, the park will also close. Though road closures prevent vehicles from driving to the North Rim during the winter season, hikers, snowshoers, and cross country skiers may enter the North Rim of the park through the winter months, provided backcountry permits have been obtained. Personal snowmobiles are NOT permitted inside the park. The North Rim reopens on May 15 of every year.",

Note two wheelchair accessible parking spaces to the left of the sidewalk. Additional parallel car parking spaces are available to the left and right. A concrete sidewalk in front of the parking areas meets up with a central, 10-foot (three meter) wide sidewalk that leads south about 20 feet to the covered, wood-plank porch of the General Store. Note along the sidewalk at the left are two conventional, green metal garbage cans next to a wildlife-proof garbage can. Two large diameter, eight-foot (two and a half meter) tall log posts support the porch roof in front at the left and right. A log railing runs along the front of both sides of the eight-foot deep porch. Note a number of small tables and chairs on the porch behind the railing at the left and right. Also note a number of chairs on the far side of the porch along the outside wall of the store. A fire extinguisher hangs on the outside wall to the left just beyond a window. Beyond a window to the right hangs a bulletin board with notifications about ranger programs in the park. Continue forward across the porch to a set of double wood and glass doors, and move inside the store. Here you\u2019ll find a wide variety of groceries and gifts, first aid supplies, as well as camping gear and water filtration equipment. The checkout counter is located along the left-hand wall. Back outside the store, the sidewalk continues south along the side of the building to the women\u2019s restroom, then continues south to the men\u2019s restroom beyond. Note a small picnic area to the east of the Grocery Store, with several tables set under a high canopy of ponderosa pine.",

      "audioDescription": "From the shuttle bus stop, move 80 feet (24 m) east along a 2-foot (60 cm) high stone wall lining the inside of the asphalt sidewalk to a 3-foot (1 m) wide opening on your left. Move away from the road down three stone steps onto another asphalt sidewalk and proceed 20 feet (6 m) forward to a vast overlook lined with a 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing running left-to-right along the edge of the canyon. At the northernmost corner of a wide promontory, Pima Point provides a vista of over 40 miles (64 km) along Grand Canyon, from Bright Angel Canyon in the east all the way west to Powell Plateau and the Great Scenic Divide. Grand Canyon rock layers are on full display from the 2-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the canyon up through the various layers of sandstone, shale, and limestone all the way up to the rim. Far below, the Colorado River is visible in several places as it winds through deep gorges, including Granite Rapids to the east. Stand still, be quiet, close your eyes. Can you hear the distant roar of the rapids, or the wing beat of a passing raven? Various sections of the Hermit Trail are in view, zigzagging down through rocky buttes, as are the meandering paths of numerous side creeks lined with green vegetation. Debris flows appear in several places on the faces of the canyon walls, evidence of side washes where raging water rushed over cliff edges, triggering avalanches of rock, mud, water, and depositing boulders in their wake\u2014sometimes all the way into the river below.",

      "audioDescription": "A low limestone wall runs along the north side of an asphalt paved sidewalk at the 60-foot (18 m) long shuttle bus stop, here at Pipe Creek Vista. The wall continues 100 feet (30 m) east past some additional parking spaces. This viewpoint looks down onto Pipe Creek, the major canyon between the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail. Douglas-fir trees thrive in a shielded niche just below the rim where there is sufficient water to sustain their survival. A 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing runs along the rim offering many vistas, beside a small forest of ponderosa pine, and pinyon-juniper woodland. The shaggy, twisty shrub known as cliffrose is also found in this area. It has reddish-brown bark, and blooms persistently and profusely from spring through fall. The blossoms are creamy or yellowish, up to an inch wide and quite fragrant. Listen for birds as this is also a prime bird migratory path across the canyon. The Rim Trail follows the rim from Pipe Creek Vista west to Hermits Rest. The section of the Rim Trail between Pipe Creek Vista and Maricopa Point is paved, and mostly wheelchair accessible.",

      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 7, Point Imperial. 4 \u00bc minutes. The road to Point Imperial leads north from the \u2018Y\u2019 nearly three miles (four and a half kilometers) to a one-way loop road at the point itself. At the far end of the loop road, to the right, a row of parallel car parking spaces faces a six-foot wide asphalt sidewalk. Larger recreational vehicles may parallel park at the left alongside a second sidewalk, beside a grove of trees with several picnic tables. Note there are vault toilets located at the far northern end of the picnic area. A wide concrete walkway leads to two pairs of gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible vault toilets at the left and right. Just beyond the open doorways to the toilets, note also there is a wildlife-proof garbage can, flanked by two recycling cans for plastic, glass, and aluminum. About two-thirds of the way around the parking lot loop to the right, opposite two wheelchair accessible parking spaces, a six-foot (two meter) wide asphalt path lined with small boulders leads east down a slight incline from the lot towards the point. At the head of the path to the left, a five-foot (one and a half meter) tall wooden sign stands before a roughly 30 foot (nine meter) wide dirt and gravel area under a stand of tall Ponderosa pine. Block capital letters read, \u201cPOINT IMPERIAL, ELV 8803\u201d (2684 meters). About 30 feet straight ahead from the elevation sign, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim to the east. Entitled, \u201cMissing Layers,\u201d it discusses why no dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. To the left of the wayside panel, a wooden bench overlooks the rim. Note there are no guardrails between the bench and rim. To the left of the bench, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail overlooks the rim. Entitled \u201cGrand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint,\u201d it discusses the very different view of the rock layers here. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. About 30 feet to the right of the elevation sign, note a second wooden bench in an open, dirt and gravel area behind a low, half-log wooden bench closer to the rim. Note there are no guardrails here, either. Continuing down the wheelchair accessible asphalt path towards the point, it first curves slightly left, then turns sharply back right down a slightly steeper incline along the rim\u2019s edge to a flight of concrete stairs with metal handrails on either side. Eleven stairs lead halfway down to a concrete landing, followed by eleven more stairs to a concrete landing at the bottom of the staircase. Continuing forward from the landing, move onto the rough, rocky terrain of the roughly 30 foot long by 10 foot wide (nine by three meter) lookout area at Point Imperial. Note the entire area is surrounded by four-foot tall metal railings. From here at the most northern boundary of the park, visitors take in panoramic views of the Painted Desert and the eastern end of Grand Canyon and Vermilion Cliffs beyond. The canyon transforms from the narrow walls of Marble Canyon to a more open and dramatic \"grand\" canyon. Layers of red and black Precambrian rocks add contrast and color. Note at the far northern end of the parking lot, a wooden sign to the right of a dirt and gravel trail identifies the Point Imperial trail (5.4 miles roundtrip; 8.7 kilometers) that ends at the north park boundary. A second, smaller wooden sign shows the distances to the Saddle Mountain Trail (2.2 miles, 3.5 kilometers), and the Nankoweap Trail (5.2 miles, 8.4 kilometers). Note also at the far southern end of the lot, a 15-foot (five meter) wide, stone staircase leads down one step to a stone landing, then down three more stone steps to a dirt and gravel area and the beginning of the unpaved Ken Patrick Trail in a grove of trees. The 9.8 mile (15.8 kilometer) trail winds through the forest and along the rim to the North Kaibab Trail parking area. Sub-Script Missing Layers Wayside Panel A panoramic color vista of the canyon from Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. The Vermillion and Echo Cliffs are just visible far off in the distance, with the tall Kaibab limestone cliffs close in the foreground. Entitled \u201cMissing Layers,\u201d words at the top left read: In the distant view you can see the Mesozoic rocks of the Vermilion and Echo cliffs, where the nearest dinosaur fossils are found. No dinosaur fossils have been unearthed in Grand Canyon, but that does not mean dinosaurs never roamed here. Mesozoic rock layers\u2014a mile (1.6 km) thick\u2014once covered the canyon\u2019s Kaibab Limestone layer, the rock where you are standing. When the Kaibab Plateau rose up 70\u201340 million years ago, the soft overlaying Mesozoic rock cracked, broke, and eroded away. Like hosing mud from a cement driveway, the Mesozoic rock vanished from the hard-surfaced Kaibab Limestone, washing away all evidence of dinosaurs. At the top right, additional red cliffs shown in two small inset color photographs are identified as Zion and Glen Canyon. A caption above reads: North of the Vermilion Cliffs in Utah are Zion, Capitol Reef, Glen Canyon, and Arches national park sites, all carved from Mesozoic rocks. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of a young boy facing us with his arms outstretched to the sides. Entitled, \u201cArms Span Time,\u201d words next to a short, vertical white line by his fingertips at the left read, \u201cEarth Forms.\u201d Moving right, words next to a short, vertical white line by his right shoulder read, \u201cOldest Grand Canyon rocks.\u201d By his thumb at the right, \u201cYoungest Grand Canyon rocks.\u201d At the base of his fingers, \u201cAge of dinosaurs.\u201d And finally by his fingertips at the far right, \u201cGrand Canyon carved,\u201d and \u201cToday.\u201d Grand Canyon Vista: Highest Viewpoint Wayside Panel A panoramic, labeled color vista of the canyon from this spot at Point Imperial fills the face of the panel. At the left there is the Marble Platform, Nankoweap Mesa, and the Colorado River (hidden), with the Supergroup rocks in the left foreground. The Desert Fa\u00e7ade appears at the center left, and the much closer, pyramid-shaped Mt. Hayden at the right. Text at the top reads: As you look east from Point Imperial\u2019s vista, you command the highest viewpoint in the park, at 8,803 feet (2,684 m). The view is very different here. There is no visible basement rock in the rock layers\u2014the river has not cut that deeply yet. Prominent in the middle view are the Supergroup rocks, the middle rock layers of the canyon, often absent or obscured. The distant Marble Platform is a 2,700 foot (820 m) step down from Point Imperial. Though not visible in the view, as the raven flies, you are nearly seven miles (11 km) removed from the Colorado River. The river meanders its course more than a mile (1.6 km) below this elevation. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of the Washington Monument and Reflecting Pool. Text reads: Highest Vista, Biggest Drop You are at the highest viewpoint looking at the deepest view. Directly east is Nankoweap Mesa\u2014the mesa topped with Limestone west of the Desert Facade. Behind this mesa is the river, some 6,000 feet (1,830 m) below us here \u2013 translated in Washington Monuments: that is 10 of them stacked end to end.",

(6.4 km round-trip) trail passes through areas burned by the 2000 Outlet Fire and ends at the northern park boundary. From there, connections are possible to the Nankoweap Trail and Kaibab National Forest.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing:\u00a0proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

      "audioDescription": "Two openings in the low 2-foot (60 cm) high limestone wall lead north away from the sidewalk at the shuttle bus stop, two, 6-foot (2 m) wide asphalt-paved paths are lined with low, irregular stones. One path leads down a set of three stone steps. The more western path leads to a wheelchair accessible ramp. The two paths converge about 30 feet (9 m) along. Move 200 feet (60 m) forward on the path along the narrow point to a 12-foot (3.5 m) tall by 20-foot (6 m) wide limestone memorial\u2014a Mayan-style truncated pyramid with a central staircase. Nearby, a photograph at the top right of a 3-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel, shows a bearded man in the canyon, next to an etching depicting long wooden boats running the rapids. Text on the panel reads: \"Early Explorer This monument honors Major John Wesley Powell, the leader of the first documented expedition through Grand Canyon. Imagine entering the depths of Grand Canyon down a roaring, not-yet-charted river, not knowing whether you will emerge. Because Powell's first expedition in 1869 was more survival than science, he led a second in 1871-1872, which gave America its first geologic glimpse of the canyon. Powell's crew prepares to shove off at Green River, Wyoming on their 1871-1872 expedition.\" Two 3-foot (1 m) wide by 3-foot (1 m) tall stone railings line either side of the central 8-foot (2.4 m) wide, 15-step stone staircase of the monument, leading up to a 10x12-foot (3x4-meter) platform. Text below an image of a man with thinning hair and a long, bushy beard, cast into the center of a 6-foot (2 m) wide by 4-foot (1.2 m) tall metal plaque at the back of the landing, reads: \"Erected by the Congress of the United States to Major John Wesley Powell first explorer of the Grand Canyon who descended the river with his party in row boats traversing the gorge beneath this point August 17, 1869 and again September 1, 1872.\" Two circular metal plaques on the left face of the monument commemorate the 50th and 75th anniversaries of Grand Canyon National Park. A similar plaque on the right face commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Powell expedition in 1969. A portrait of a young, bearded man fills the center. The asphalt path continues around both sides of the monument and converges 30 feet (9 m) behind the structure. Two wooden benches sit to the left of each path, at the back of a 20-foot (6 m) wide open viewing area located on the point itself. Note there are no railings here, the viewing platform being ringed only by a series of large stones.",

A two-way shuttle bus stop makes visiting here easy and a nice quick option for those limited on time.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>The story of Grand Canyon as we know it is tied directly to John Wesley Powell.\u00a0As a geologist\u00a0Powell\u00a0grew interested in exploring the unknown canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers. He studied reports from earlier expeditions, but in the late 1800s there wasn't much to go on and most of what was available was inaccurate and jaded by the perceptions of early explorers. Gathering\u00a0support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads,\u00a0educational institutions, and Congress for his expedition down the Green River. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869 to explore the course of the river, fill in the blank spots that littered maps of the southwest, and to gather scientific data.<br /> <br /> After three summer months spent exploring the upper canyons of the Colorado River, the expedition passed the Paria River on August 4 hungry, exhuasted both mentally and physically, and with only musty apples, spoiled bacon, wet flour, and coffee remaining to sustain them they entered the last and greatest of the canyons. The scientific expedition had turned into a fight for their very survival as they entered into Grand Canyon.\u00a0Powell referred to Grand Canyon as \u201c<em>our granite prison</em>\u201d and described an almost unbroken series of rapids that the expedition ran, lined, or portaged, praying all the while for an end to the ordeal. On August 28, the canyon ended and the river became relatively quiet once again. They had survived, and in doing so became the first recorded people to successfully navigate from Green River, Wyoming to the Black Canyon of Arizona/Neveda.<br /> <br /> After a near disatrous first trip that cost\u00a0Powell\u2019s most of his notes and\u00a0scientific data, a few boats, and multiple men,\u00a0he secured\u00a0full federal funding to a second trip. Powell gathered a new\u00a0crew, this time including amateur scientists and educated men, and he\u00a0began a second expedition on May 22, 1871. Between his two trips down the river Powell gathered invaulable information and data and literally helped to put Grand Canyon on a map. Further studies in the area over the next few years, by both Powell and his peers in the geologic community, helped to lay the foundation of how we understand Grand Canyon geology today.\u00a0</p>",

As the canyon grew in popularity and year after year saw increases to park visitation the services the National Park Service and its partners have provided have had to grow\u00a0and the Village was expanded to include the Market Plaza and Grand Canyon Visitor Center Plaza.<br /> <br /> Some buildings have been lost over the years, like the gas station that used to sit where the parking lot now is, while others have found new purpose. How would you change or adapt to help protect something you loved?<br /> <br /> Today, this building\u00a0serves as the park's law enforcement center and is <b>not open to the public</b>. If you have an medical or law enforcement emergency please call 9-1-1.</p>",

Text at the top right reads: \"Revealing Features Mary Colter's attention to detail is reflected in every element of the Desert View Watchtower. Each rock and painted wall was intended to convey meaning. Colter used ornamental details, seeming haphazardly, to create an added charm of the unexpected. Find triangular and diamond patterned rocks, horizontal bands of different sizes, and actual petroglyphs with pecked designs. The tower features T-shaped doors and tapered windows like buildings hundreds of years old. Colter used uneven masonry surfaces to \"create shadow and give more vigor to the walls.\" At the bottom left of the panel, text continues: \"Stories Preserved in Stone Many ideas from Colter's research trips emerge in this architectural masterpiece. Climb the 85 steps and allow the artists' and masons' details to reveal themselves.\" The first of 4 black-and-white photographs to the right shows a man wearing jeans, a long-sleeve white shirt, and a headband standing next to a T-shaped stone door from Chaco Culture National Historical Park, followed by a close-up of diamond-patterned rocks from the same location. The next picture of petroglyphs from the Painted Desert shows various animal and human figures and a sun spirit. The last photograph shows a couple perpendicular stone walls with intermingled rows of roughly rectangular- and triangular-shaped stones\u2014examples of ornamental masonry from Wupatki National Monument.",

      "bodyText": "<p>The Rim Trail is a mostly paved path that stretches roughly 13 miles (21 km) along the southern rim of Grand Canyon from South Kaibab Trailhead in the east to Hermits Rest in the west. Most people won't hike the whole trail in one go, but walking short sections of the rim\u00a0can provide an excellent chance to stretch the legs after a long car ride, take a break from riding the shuttle, or to get away from a busy viewpoint for a moment. No matter how much of it you walk, you'll get lots of good views along the way!<br /> <br /> <strong>One-way Distances from Mather Point along the Rim Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> South Kaibab Trail - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum - 0.7 miles (1 km)<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Bright Angel Trailhead - 2.5 miles (4 km)<br /> Hermits Rest - 11 miles (18 km)</p> <h2>Popular Sections</h2> <h4>Mather Point to Yavapai Geology Museum</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 0.7 mi (1 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong>: </span>15\u201330 minutes<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade.\u00a0<br /> <br /> This short\u00a0section of the trail is one of the most popular as it is easily accessible from both Mather and Yavapai Points and it offers constant views of Grand Canyon, as well as Phantom Ranch and a glimpse of the Colorado River far below. Even walking part of this section guarentees some great Grand Canyon vistas.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0When the Kaibab/Rim (Orange) Route shuttle bus\u00a0is running to Mather Point and the Yavapai Geology Museum it links the two ends of this section for an easy one-way hike.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h4>Mather Point to Grand Canyon Historic Village</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 2.5 mi (4 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong></span>: 45 minutes to 2 hours<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibbility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. (It is largely downhill heading east to west from Mather to the Village)<br /> <br /> This 2.5 mile stretch of the Rim Trail includes the section above, and\u00a0expands it west to include the trail to/from\u00a0the historic village.\u00a0While you can walk this section in under an hour it is recommended to plan for a longer trip as you'll want to take your time to appreciate all the good views, snag a few pictures,\u00a0and experience the Trail of Time, which overlaps this section of the rim. The 2 mile\u00a0(3.5 km) section between Yavapai Geology Museum and the Grand Canyon Historic Village can be hot and sunny in the summer time so\u00a0be sure to take water, snacks, and sun protection. Water and restrooms\u00a0are\u00a0available at the Geology Museum, Grand Canyon Visitor and at multiple spots in the village. This section of the trail is quite popular as well, but offers more opportunities for solitude and quiet moments along the canyon's edge.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Village (Blue) Route shuttle bus\u00a0is running transportation will run between the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village to help complete a one-way loop.\u00a0</p> <h4>Grand Canyon Historic Village to Hermits Rest</h4> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Length</span>:\u00a0</strong>7 mi (11 km) one way<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Time:</span>\u00a0</strong>3+ hours<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Accessibility:</span> </strong>The section between Monuement Creek Vista and Pima Point is paved and accessible, but the rest of the Rim Trail along the Hermit Road is <strong>NOT</strong> accessible. The rest of the trail is a mix of dirt and paved paths with\u00a0the paved sections including\u00a0steep grades and steps.\u00a0<br /> <br /> The views along this section of the Rim Trail offer some of the best views of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road and can help get you away from the crowds at the major viewpoints along the way. There is limited water and restrooms availability along the Hermit Road so be prepared for longer hikes. Most hikers will use the shuttle system to jump along the road to\u00a0do shorter sections of the trail and to return to the beginning of the scenic road. <i>Most</i>\u00a0of the stops are about 1 mile from each other, though a few are longer, check your <strong>Pocket Map</strong> for a break down of the Rim Trail from point to point.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Hermit Rest (Red) Route shuttle bus is running it will stop at each of the major viewpoints and access points along the Rim Trail through this section.\u00a0</p> <h4><span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">Safety - Hike Smart</span></h4> <p>- Take water, snacks, and sun protection with you on your hike. At 7,000 ft (2000 m) in elevation even a hike on the rim can leave you dehydrated, tired, and sun burnt.\u00a0<br /> - Stay on designated trails and walkways and always keep a safe distance of at least six feet (2 m) from the edge of the canyon rim.<br /> - In areas where there is a railing or fence, do not climb over the barrier.<br /> - Know where the edge is. Watch foot placement and look for trip hazards.<br /> - Never throw rocks, coins, trash, or anything else over the edge.<br /> - Early summer temperatures can be HOT. Highs will often reach the low to mid 90s <sup>o</sup>F (...<sup>o</sup>C) and even the canyon rim can reach temperatures above 100<sup>o</sup>F\u00a0(38<sup>o</sup>C). Check the weather and be prepared.<br /> - The late summer season brings rain and thunderstorms to Grand Canyon. Remember, \"If it roars, Go indoors\".\u00a0Lightning can and often does strike the edge of the canyon as thunderstorms pass over the area.\u00a0</p>",

To the left of a rock bearing the Theodore Roosevelt plaque, a short trail leads through overgrowth to an overlook. Here, a USGS medallion marks the end of the trail.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>A staunch conservationist, avid outdoorsman and hunter, Theodore Roosevelt cared about natural resources with a burning passion. He is also said to have rode a mule down the Bright Angel Trail in 1903 to tell the Havasupai people they had to leave their home, now Indian Garden, to create a National Park.<br /> <br /> During his first visit to Grand Canyon in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed, \"Leave it as it is. You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.\"<br /> <br /> On June 8, 1906, Roosevelt signed into legislation the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a> , which enabled the President \"...to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments..\"<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1908, Roosevelt officially recognized the significance of Grand Canyon by using this same order to proclaim it a national monument. In 1919, three years after the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, it was officially designated as a national park.<br /> <br /> In his time as President of the United States, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTeddy' used his authority to protect wildlife and public lands in unprecedented fashion. He created the United States Forest Service (USFS) in 1905 and established 150 national forests. In addition, Roosevelt also authorized the creation of 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments under the Antiquities Act. In total, Theodore Roosevelt protected approximately 230 million acres of public land.<br /> <br /> Today, the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, both positive and negative, is found across the country. There are six national park sites dedicated, in part or whole, to our conservationist president. You can find more information about these places, including North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park, under these <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-related-web-sites.htm\">related websites</a> .</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A D Stop 5, Roosevelt Point. 2 \u00bc minutes. Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, just under two miles (three kilometers) beyond Vista Encantada, a small pullout to the left leads to a one-lane parking area. A three-foot (one meter) wide asphalt sidewalk runs along the side of the road on the canyon side. In the center of the sidewalk, a paved central path leads east to a large boulder at the right with a roughly two foot (60 cm) square metal plaque affixed to its front. At the top left of the plaque is a three-dimensional image of Theodore Roosevelt with a bushy mustache and eyebrows, wearing a monocle. Text on the plaque reads: ROOSEVELT POINT Named in honor of the 26th President of the United States for his efforts towards the preservation of the Grand Canyon. A 1903 quote on the plaque by Theodore Roosevelt reads: Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it. What you can do is keep it for your children, for your children\u2019s children, and for all that come after you, as the one great sight which every American \u2026 should see. Moving about 20 feet (six meters) past the boulder, down a slight incline, the paved path leads past a wooden bench at the right, ending at a narrow dirt and gravel border in front of a line of boulders along the rim. Note there is also a small, wood-covered shelter set over the boulders to the right. To the left of the central path, a wayside panel mounted on a three-foot (one meter) tall angled, metal reading rail along the line of boulders talks about how the uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At the north end of the small roadside parking area, a short trail leads downhill to several wooden benches at the Roosevelt Point viewpoint. The upper end of a long, thin ridge extends four miles (six and a half kilometers) eastwards, descending several thousand feet in a series of mesas and buttes. Sub-Script Big Step Down Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Roosevelt Point fills the face of the panel. Entitled \u201cBig Step Down,\u201d words at the top left read: Looking east from Roosevelt Point, the opposite side of Grand Canyon lies far below. This entire region, 75 million years ago, was a smooth plain stretching off to the east. About five million years later, that landscape began to change. North America drifted westward, squeezing the western landscape, and the land began to rise. Far to the east, the Rocky Mountains folded and buckled skyward. Here, on the Colorado Plateau, the uplift was smoother. Even so, the Kaibab Plateau where you stand was pushed about 2,400 feet (732 m) higher than the Marble Platform to the east, creating a big step down. In the center of the panel, a white circle surrounds a portion of the Marble Platform far off in the distance, with a white line connecting to a circular, inset color photograph of that location. In the photograph, a clearly identifiable fault line runs between steep, rocky walls. A caption reads: Sharp eyes or binoculars help you spot the fault line separating the Kaibab Plateau from the Marble Platform. Here the normally flat rock layers of the canyon were bent upward, showing where the big step rose vertically over the Butte Fault. Text at the lower left of the panel reads: The uplift of the Kaibab Plateau 70 million years ago created the highest elevations in Grand Canyon. Here, at Roosevelt Point, we stand 2,400 feet (732 m) above Marble Platform and more than 8,400 feet (2,560 m) above sea level.",

An easy one-mile walk along an old dirt road takes one through ponderosa forest, which eventually transitions to a pinyon-juniper woodland near the rim of the canyon. A relatively quiet viewpoint along the rim of the canyon facing north-northeast awaits at the end of the walk.<br /> <br /> Shoshone Point is the only area within the park that can be reserved for private events and gatherings. Please respect the use of the site for those who have gone through the reservation and permitting process. If the gate blocking the use of the road/trail is open or unlocked, please reconsider visiting the site.<br /> <br /> For those not reserving this area for an event, it is a short 2-mile round trip hike that follows a\u00a0dirt road out to the rim of the Grand Canyon for views toward the Desert View Watchtower and across the canyon to the North Rim.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>In spring the road tends to be very muddy as the snow thaws on the canyon rim. Please stick to the road and be prepared for the conditions of the season.\u00a0</p> <h3>Group Events</h3> <p>The park offers this area for groups wishing to host a wedding, celebrate a birthday, conduct a memorial service, hold a family reunion, or a similar event. The site features a covered pavilion, picnic tables, grills, trash cans, and a vault toilet. There is no water or electricity. An unimproved dirt road leads to this isolated area.<br /> <br /> You may obtain a permit for a reservation no earlier than one year prior to the requested date on a first come, first-served basis. To obtain a permit, visit: http://www.nps.gov/grca/parkmgmt/sup.htm.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>Shoshone Point is named after the Shoshone tribe, a North American Indian group that occupied a territory that is now southeastern California, across central and eastern Nevada and northwestern Utah into southern Idaho and western Wyoming. Today, the Shoshone still live on reservations throughout the west in the states or Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "A little over a mile (1.6 km) east of Yaki Point Road, an unsigned turn-off on the north side of Desert View Drive leads to a small parking lot in the forest. A locked gate at the north end of the lot limits access to an unpaved, single lane road that leads one mile (1.6 km) through the forest to Shoshone Point. Smell the air. A prescribed fire once burned here. The flames licked and blackened the trunks and branches of the ponderosa pine trees of this forest, completely engulfing some, and felling others. New grasses and pine saplings sprout up through the bed of pine needles covering the ground. Touch the five to nine inch (12 to 23 cm) long needles, bound together in bundles of three. Notice the different color bark of the trees. Young trees have rough black bark, while older trees have deep orange-brown bark. About 50 feet (15 m) back from the road and 25 feet (8 m) west of the parking lot stands an 80-foot (24 m) tall double-trunk ponderosa pine tree with a blackened trunk. Move to this tree, being mindful of the uneven ground and shallow trench cut into the soil. Touch the thick, rough bark of this mature tree. Find a deep fissure in the bark, and put your nose into it to smell the sweet aromas of vanilla and butterscotch.",

      "audioDescription": "On the east side of the mule corral on the Bright Angel trailhead plaza, a color photograph on a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel shows a cowboy standing in front of a line of eight mules with large packs strapped to their backs. The walls of the canyon rise behind them. Text at the top left reads: \"Mule Power At Grand Canyon you can fill your senses with mules. You can smell them, hear their brays, see them snake down trails like trains, feel them as you sway on their saddled backs, and even taste their dust as they pass you on the trail. A cross between a male donkey and a female horse, mules are sensitive spirits in robust bodies. Grand Canyon is one of the few remaining places in the United States where mules are a common sight. Once prevalent on American farms, they are now largely replaced by tractors and trucks. At Grand Canyon, they excel at the jobs they are bred for: pack work and riding.\" Text at the lower left continues: \"For more than a century, mules have carried almost everything imaginable in and out of Grand Canyon. With only trails through the wilderness below the rim, the mules will likely work for a long time.\" A quote at the top center by Theodore H. Savory from Scientific American reads: \"The mule...is courageous and intelligent, hard of hide, sure of foot, sound of constitution and able to resist changes in climate and withstand thirst and hunger better than the horse.\" A green circle in the upper right-hand corner surrounds a park ranger hat with the words, \"Junior Ranger.\" Three figures in silhouette do the biological math showing how a female horse plus a male donkey equals a mule. Text continues: \"When a female horse is bred with a male donkey the offspring is a mule. The donkey gives the mule its short thick head, long ears, and short mane, while the horse shares its height and body shape. Mules come in all shapes and sizes, influenced largely by their mother. With all the breeds, like quarter horses, draft horses, or shaggy ponies, what kind of mule mix can you imagine? \"",

In 1914, Fred Harvey company took a bold step to compete against Kolb Studio (just west of here). They asked Mary Colter to design a building on the promontory in front of you, to lure visitors away from the competition. Colter did just that, creating an organic design, which captivated visitors and integrated into the natural surroundings. Can you tell where Colter's walls end and the canyon walls begin?\"<br />A quote from a 1915 Lookout Studio brochure continues:<br />\"A tiny rustic club is The Lookout with its bright hued Navajo rugs, electric lights, cozy fireplace and many easy chairs.\"<br />Text at the lower left reads:<br />\"\"The Lookout,\" as originally named, was designed as a leisurely space for visitors to gaze upon the canyon and purchase souvenir photos and postcards.\"<br />A black-and-white photograph at the lower right shows two women in long coats and wide-brimmed hats standing in bright sunlight looking at a set of rolled architectural drawings. A caption reads:<br />\"Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter (right) designed the Hopi House in 1905, and Hermits Rest and Lookout Studio in 1914. Colter captured the \"taste and charm\" Fred Harvey company and Santa Fe Railway sought for their buildings.

On either side of you, tall and densely clustered pine or aspen trees abruptly end at the edges of this large meadow. The open area that you see extends for miles.<br /> <br /> Why would these vibrant forests suddenly stop invading an open, rolling grassy landscape? Several factors are linked to this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> <b>Wildfire</b> has certainly played a role.<br /> <br /> <b>Drainage</b> is also a limiting factor. Trees are skilled at soaking up water, though seedlings may have a hard time growing in locations exposed to greater amounts of sun, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> <b>Soil chemistry</b> is also a consideration. Natural toxins and higher alkaline concentrations can prevent the growth of woody plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Competition</b> is significant. For example, Ponderosa pine trees struggle to grow in areas dominated by established grasses. <b>Variations in bedrock</b> (primarily Kaibab limestone) may also affect how deep or suitable an area is for seedling growth. And grazing <b>wildlife</b>, like mule deer and bison, keep vegetation low and trimmed.<br /> <br /> You can also observe this phenomenon along the beginning of Cape Royal Road, here on the North Rim.</p> <h3>Bison Safety</h3> <ul> <li>Bison are wild animals and are unpredictable.</li> <li>Maintain a distance of 100 feet (30 m) from bison.</li> <li>When the bison are within 100 feet (30 m) of the road, it is recommended to view wildlife from inside a vehicle.</li> <li>Please use established gravel or paved pull-outs to park vehicles completely off the roadway (all wheels right of the white line).

Walking east from Grand Canyon Village takes you forward in time, from Grand Canyon's oldest rocks to canyon carving and Grand Canyon's human history.<br /> <br /> This is the \"old\" end of the main Trail of Time, so the theme for the paving stones and seating rocks around the portal is Precambrian schist and gneiss of the type found in the inner gorges, near the bottom of the canyon. Walk a bit further east along the trail and you can see and touch the oldest known rock of Grand Canyon's basement rocks!</p> <h3>Trail of Time Overview</h3> <p>The Trail of Time is the world's largest geoscience exhibition at one of the world's grandest geologic landscapes, Grand Canyon National Park. The trail utilizes the unique vistas and rocks of Grand Canyon to help visitors ponder, explore, and understand the magnitude of geologic time and the stories encoded by Grand Canyon rocks and landscapes. Geologic time is immensely long. The 4.56 km (2.8 mi) trail is marked every meter, with 1 meter = 1 million years of our 4,560,000,000 year-long Earth history. Viewing tubes, rocks on plinths, and wayside panels help visitors connect the rocks visible in Grand Canyon to their place along the timeline.<br /> <br /> The main Trail of Time can be entered at different points - including the east end near Yavapai Point (young end), west end at Grand Canyon Village (old end), or a middle point where a connecting trail comes from the Park Headquarters parking area (Parking Lot A). Shuttle stops connect each entry point, so you can walk it in several ways and still get back to your car. The entry portals have messages on each side appropriate for those approaching (welcome) or for those completing different segments of the Trail (congratulations).<br /> <br /> Located on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, the Trail of Time extends along the paved Rim Trail between the Yavapai Geology Museum on the east and Maricopa Point on the west. The main portion of the Trail between Yavapai Geology Museum and Grand Canyon Village is accessible to wheelchairs and baby strollers, and it is convenient to shuttle bus stops and parking areas in a heavily-visited section of the park.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Trail of Time is a 3.1 mile (5 km) wheelchair accessible interactive trail that winds along the rim on a wide, relatively level paved surface. Along the side of the trail, low concrete pedestals display actual Grand Canyon rocks in a timeline of the canyon's geologic history. Bronze markers embedded in the sidewalk indicate at what point in time you are standing. Moving along the trail from Verkamp's Visitor Center, a six-foot (2 m) tall by four-foot (1.2 m) wide V-shaped rock column shows Grand Canyon's actual rock layers, brought up from deep in the canyon. Touch the column to feel the layers: the oldest black Vishnu Schist and other basement rocks at the bottom, topped by multi-colored diagonal layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, followed by more horizontal layers of rock with the Kaibab Formation at the top. Text on the west side of a three-foot (1 m) tall by two-foot (60 cm) wide panel embedded in the column reads: \"Welcome to the Trail of Time, a geology timeline. Walk 2 billion years of Grand Canyon history. See and touch samples of Grand Canyon Rocks. Discover their ages!\" An illustration at the bottom of the panel shows an older couple walking along the trail next to a woman and her young son. Text reads: \"One long step = 1 million years.\" A highlighted marker at their feet reads: \"1,970 million years ago.\" In the center of the panel, a map shows the route of the Trail of Time along the rim. Text in a yellow box in the middle of the map reads, \"You Are Here,\" pointing to the trail behind the Verkamp's Visitor Center, next to other buildings in the Village. Maricopa Point is at the left, to the west. The Yavapai Geology Museum is at the far right to the east. The map shows shuttle bus stops and parking lot locations, and the locations of several restrooms. At the top of the map, small bits of blue show the Colorado River flowing at the bottom of the canyon. Text on the opposite east side of the panel reads: \"Congratulations! You have just walked the Trail of Time, a geology timeline covering 2 billion years of Grand Canyon history.\" Continue through the Village to Maricopa Point (2.5 km, 1.5 mi.) to the age of the Earth. An illustration at the bottom of the panel underneath the same map shows a man and woman looking west over the canyon toward Maricopa Point.",

      "audioDescription": "From the Trailview Overlook shuttle bus stop, two ramps lead north through the low limestone wall lining the sidewalk. A couple wooden benches sit on a flat, pebbly area on the other side of the wall between the two entrance points, across some low limestone boulders lining the asphalt path. Ten feet (3 m) to the east of a vertical wayside panel with an eight-foot (2.4 m) wide limestone base, a long set of concrete stairs, four-feet (1.2 m) wide with metal handrails on both sides, leads down to an overlook. Move 16 steps down to a concrete sidewalk. Follow 20 feet (6 m) along the right handrail to two more steps, then continue 20 feet (6 m) forward to where another set of stairs leads down to the right with handrails on both sides. Follow along the right handrail to move down a series of staircases and landings down a total of 54 stairs to an asphalt-paved path. Turn left and continue 25 feet (8 m) along the handrail at your right to an overlook area ringed by a four-foot (1.2 m) high metal railing. At the left, text on a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel reads: Breaking Ground Look down Garden Creek Canyon at the winding Bright Angel Trail. The Earth\u2019s crust fractured in this area, lifting one side of the rock layers and lowering the other, creating a fault. The trail follows this fault into the canyon. Water also follows the fault. Springs, like those at Indian Garden, are able to flow because the groundwater has reached impermeable rock, where it spreads out sideways and leaks out of the canyon walls as springs. A picture of the canyon from this vantage point fills the bottom two-thirds of the panel. A thick yellow line in the middle of the panel shows the location of the Bright Angel Fault, running across the bottom of the canyon through Indian Garden all the way across to the North Rim. A circular picture inset at the lower left shows your location as viewed from the North Rim of the canyon. Two cliff faces are highlighted with arrows, one pointing down, the other pointing up. A caption reads: Sixty million years ago the west side of Bright Angel Fault was lifted higher than the east side.",

The first train arrived in 1901, bringing passengers ready to marvel at Grand Canyon's one-of-a-kind views. Today this feeling continues as folks step off the train, eager to make the walk up towards El Tovar Hotel and the canyon rim.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1909-1910, the Train Depot is part of the Grand Canyon National Park National Historic Landscape District and a designated National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect Francis W. Wilson of Santa Barbara, California, the log and wood-frame structure is two stories high.<br /> <br /> Originally, the downstairs was designated for station facilities and the station agent's family inhabited the upstairs. Today, the first floor is used for railway passenger services. The building is one of 14 log depots constructed in the United States and one of only three remaining. Of the three, the Train Depot is the only one in which logs were used as the primary structural material and which still serves an operating railroad. The depot's logs are squared on three sides creating bearing surfaces, flat interior surfaces, and a rustic exterior appearance.<br /> <br /> Just beyond the depot is the El Tovar Hotel, built in 1905 by the Santa Fe Railroad. The structure is the signature hotel along the rim. The railroad built the Train Depot five years after the hotel and placed it conveniently close for the rail passengers.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "Grand Canyon Railway Depot sits at the end of the railroad tracks down the hill from El Tovar. The main facade faces south, away from the canyon.<br />The 3,000-square foot (900 square meter) log structure is primarily a one-story building with a broad, moderately-pitched gable roof with the ridge running on the long axis, parallel to the four sets of train tracks, thirty feet (9 m) across. A frame second story occupies the center third of the building, sheathed with flush planking framed by vertical log posts. This central portion is covered with another broad gabled roof at right angles to the main roof. The second story overhangs the first, supported by heavy vertical log posts, and an attic overhangs the second story, supported by log brackets. An extension of the main roof to the west at a slightly lower elevation shelters a large two-bay porch, supported on vertical log posts, and a small one-story bay projects slightly from the central block. Note there is a set of men's restrooms outside on the back-north side of the building, towards the east.<br />Inside, there are four main rooms. From west to east there is a ticket office-waiting room with several wooden benches and metal railings, an agent's office, a parcel storage room and a baggage room. Family and women's restrooms are between these rooms and the platform. Interior walls are plastered with log-slab wainscoting. Note that much of the original hardware is present. Feel the doorknobs, stamped with the letters, \"GC.\"<br />Back outside, there are a couple picnic tables underneath a tree to the east of the station next to the tracks.<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, just east of the large two-bay porch, an old black-and-white picture of the train station fills the top of a three-foot (1 m) tall angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top left reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Depot <br />In 1901, the screech of train brakes and the blast of a train whistle signaled the arrival of a new era in Grand Canyon Village. The railroad provided the most comfortable means of transportation to the canyon for more than a quarter century. This log depot, finished in 1910, welcomed train passengers to a growing village. By 1924, a community development plan was created for the village. Almost a century later, that planned community forms the core of Grand Canyon Village, centering on the last operational log depot in the country. Today, the depot is carefully preserved and still welcomes passengers to the canyon.\"<br />A smaller black-and-white picture at the lower left shows a black steam engine trailed by several cars next to a small wooden structure at the left. A caption reads:<br />\"The original depot was a small shack located west of here. The need for a larger, more sophisticated structure quickly became apparent.\"<br />Two more black-and-white photos along the right side of the panel show long lines of a half-dozen trains in front of the depot, and a parking lot full of vintage cars next to the tracks. A caption reads:<br />These photos depict a thriving Grand Canyon rail operation, but with the opening of the paved automotive highway from Williams, Arizona, in 1926, that began to change. Ridership declined for decades. Finally, in 1968, the passenger service and depot closed.<br />A color photograph at the bottom right shows a black steam engine and coal car with several trailing cars in front of the station. Another caption reads:<br />\"In 1989, passenger service resumed, bringing thousands of visitors to Grand Canyon by rail each year. Traveling this way lessens auto congestion on traffic-busy park roads.\"<br /><br />On the south side of the depot, beside two large logs in the middle of the two-bay porch, is an 18-inch (46 cm) square metal plaque mounted on an angle to the top of a four-foot (1.2 m) tall wooden pedestal. Text on the plaque reads:<br />\"Grand Canyon Railway Depot has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America, 1987, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior.\"",

These tribes include the Havasupai, Hopi, Hualapai, Southern Paiute, Navajo, Zuni, and Yavapai-Apache.<br />The central theme of the canyon is seen in the stair steps depicted in the center, surrounded by stars that represent the constellations. Water symbols on the outer ring, appearing as stylized curlicues or waves, signify the ongoing importance of rain and water in the desert southwest. The image of a hand in the center of the stairs is a reminder of all who have come this way before. <br />This tribal medallion, a collaboration between park staff and tribal colleagues, was developed as a way to introduce people to the native cultures that maintain strong cultural and spiritual ties to the canyon.",

The store was also the last family-run business in the park. From the early 1900s to early 2000s, the Verkamp family was a fixture of Grand Canyon National Park and their store was frequented by canyon visitors throughout the years.<br /> <br /> The <b>Grand Canyon Conservancy</b> operates a Park Store in the building which sells\u00a0books, souvenirs, and gifts.

      "audioDescription": "About 300 feet (90 m) east of El Tovar and Hopi House sits the grey-shingled, two-story Verkamp's Visitor Center. Nearby, an old black-and-white picture of the structure fill a three-foot (1 m) tall, angled metal wayside panel. Text at the top left reads: \"Verkamp's Curios Store Inspired by Grand Canyon's burgeoning tourism trade, in 1898, John Verkamp established a small tent shop on the South Rim, selling American Indian arts and crafts. Profits proved meager, so John sold his inventory to the Bright Angel Hotel and closed his shop. Returning in 1905, John built the permanent store you see today. His business prospered; indeed, it was his only business to survive the Great Depression. In 1936, John, his wife, and their four children moved into the apartment above the store. John managed the store until his death in 1944. His children, and eventually his grandchildren, operated the store. When it closed in 2008, it was the last echo of the canyon's pioneer businesses.\" A caption underneath the photograph reads: \"Verkamp hired El Tovar architect Charles F. Whittlesey to design his new store. Today, it serves as a visitor center.\" At the top right, an entry from John Verkamp's ledger on the opening day of his permanent curios store, January 31, 1906, reads: \"$4.98. A good day.\" A black-and-white photograph inset at the lower left shows a man in a light-colored suit and vest standing before a makeshift white tent. A caption reads: \"Verkamp traded flour, sugar, and other things to local tribes in exchange for hand-made jewelry, rugs, and pottery which he sold from this tent in 1898.\" Note there is a water filling station about 12 feet (3.6 m) to the left of this wayside.",

Travelling south along Cape Royal Road, about five miles (eight kilometers) south of the \u2018Y,\u2019 past a series of curvy switchbacks, a small pullout to the left leads to the one-lane parking area of Vista Encantada. At the north end of the pullout, a line of parking spaces faces a six-foot wide asphalt sidewalk and the rim. Further south, additional parallel parking spaces line the sidewalk. Towards the middle, the sidewalk loops toward the rim (east) to encircle an eight-foot (two-and-a-half meter) tall, double-sided, wooden wayside with a small shingle roof sitting atop a three-foot tall by four-foot wide (90 by 120 centimeter) stone base. Flat boulders ring the edge of the wayside sidewalk loop at the rim, behind a few tall Ponderosa pine trees and the canyon vista beyond. Note there are no guardrails. To the south of the wayside beyond the sidewalk, note a 15 foot (six meter) wide dirt and gravel area in front of the rim, under a tall Ponderosa pine and a large boulder at the rim itself. If you visit during the summer, Vista Encantada may be bursting with orange and yellow wildflowers, and blooming prickly pear cactus. September through December, the small fruit turns ruby red when ripe. Continuing south along the sidewalk from the wayside overlook, the path curves around to a fork where a second asphalt loop path leads left into and around a grove of trees. Under the canopy are a half-dozen picnic tables. About 20 feet (six meters) along the left-hand hand path, a wooden bench at the left peers out over the edge of the canyon. Note a pair of wildlife-proof, metal garbage cans by the sidewalk in front of the picnic area.",

Being mindful of traffic, move across the road to a flat gravel path lined with logs that leads about 400 feet (120 meters) north to an open area among the surrounding trees. Low, stacked limestone rock wall remnants outline the footprints of the half-dozen rooms of the pueblo. There is set of main rooms straight ahead, ranging in size from 10 to 15 feet (three to five meters) wide, and 10 to 20 feet (three to six meters) long. Note that this is an archeological site, and federal penalties can be imposed upon anyone who disturbs it. Touching or walking on the walls is not allowed, and removing any artifacts from this location is prohibited. Remains of adobe and beams in the rubble of these rooms indicated that the stone-walled rooms had roofs through which people entered by ladder. Near the north wall of the second room is a small, slab-lined fire pit. There are two smaller, separate rooms here to the west, and at the far end of the pueblo, a visible entryway connects the two large rooms built at the back. In the middle of the far wall of the last big room, stands a large, limestone slab, placed on-edge. Note to the west of the two back rooms of the main pueblo, two long rows of half-log benches face the pueblo under the trees. A second set of pueblo room remains stand to the east of the main pueblo, closer to the road. Consisting of one large and two smaller rooms, there is archaeological evidence these structures were built after the main structure burned down.",

A five foot (two meter) wide asphalt sidewalk stretches over 500 feet (150 meters) south between the parking lane curb and a line of boulders at the edge of the canyon. About 150 feet (45 meters) along the sidewalk, a three-foot tall wayside panel mounted on an angled, metal reading rail tells the story of Puebloan farmers who once made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis. A description of this panel is included in the sub-script below. At this location, far below us, the Unkar Creek has carved a wide swath of rocky walls and sloping banks that open up to a panorama of the canyon floor and Unkar Delta. Fifteen miles (24 kilometers) in the distance, the walls of the South Rim rise steeply to a flat, desert plain. Much closer, off to the right, just beyond the point at Cape Royal, Vishnu Temple rises 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) into the air, topped with a pyramid-like limestone caprock. Sub-Script Living Delta to Rim Wayside Panel A panoramic color photograph of the canyon from Walhalla Overlook fills the face of the panel. Entitled \u201cLiving Delta to Rim,\u201d words at the top of the panel read: From the North Rim, the Colorado River and the Unkar Delta below seem distant, yet ancestral Puebloan farmers 1,100 to 800 years ago made the journey from river to rim on a routine basis, spending summers on the rim and most of the remainder of the year within the canyon. For nearly five generations (about 100 years) farmers moved between Unkar Delta and Walhalla Glades, their summer home (across the road behind you). They successfully planted crops along the river, near water sources in side canyons, and on the North Rim. Corn, beans, and squash were their principle crops, but they also supplemented their diet with wild game, leafy plants, roots, nuts, and berries. The stone foundations of their dwellings, along with the artifacts left behind, tell stories of vibrant communities living in the harsh canyon environment. At the left, a white line from the Unkar Delta, far below in the center of the panel, connects to a circular inset photograph of rows of rocks arranged in neat squares and rectangles on the ground. A caption reads: Archaeologists can still piece together the stories of Unkar Delta\u2019s ancient farming communities, even though floods have washed much of the evidence away. At the lower right, a green, circular Junior Ranger icon appears over an inset color photograph of more low, interconnected stone walls in a grove of trees. Text reads: Camp Walhalla Glades If you have been to summer camp, you probably traveled there by car or bus. Ancestral Puebloan children walked and climbed miles to their summer camp (across the road behind you), called Walhalla Glades. Find their winter home in the view and see if you can plot a route the children might have followed to camp. \u2003",

      "audioDescription": "Situated on prominent Yavapai Point, Yavapai Geology Museum is an irregularly-shaped one-story building, approximately 40-feet (12 m) deep by 65-feet (20 m) wide, with a semi-circular observation enclosed terrace on the north side overlooking the canyon. The structure's exterior walls and foundation are made of uniformly-sized, native Kaibab Formation boulders with buttressed corners which give the building a rich variation in form, texture, and line. The building has a low, flat asphalt roof, timber beams, and protruding wood rafters. Other rustic characteristics include small window openings, and timber doors. The splayed courses of the building merge into the surrounding curbing and paving stones. Inside, a vast 3,000 square foot (900 square meter) room houses a wide variety of geology exhibits that showcase the canyon's history, including a scale model of Grand Canyon, samples of its geologic layers, plant and animal fossils, specimens of modern flora and fauna common to the region, and maps and charts for public use. The entire north wall is covered with a series of five 10-foot (3 m) wide by five-foot (1.5 m) tall windows with sweeping views of the North Rim, the inner canyon, and the Colorado River far below. A variety of interpretive displays explain the deposition of the canyon's strata, the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, and the role of the Colorado River in carving Grand Canyon over time. These exhibits are augmented by daily interpretive talks conducted by National Park Service park rangers about Grand Canyon's geologic history. There is a small Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store on the opposite side of the room from the windows at the left. While there are no restrooms inside the museum, they are available down a short paved trail at the parking lot.",

      "bodyText": "<p><strong>Note: the amphitheater benches are being renovated and should be installed during spring 2025. It is still possible to walk up to the railing for exceptional views of the canyon during sunrise and sunset.</strong><br /> <br /> Just a short walk east of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/yavapai-geology-museum.htm\">Yavapai Geology Museum</a>, Yavapai Point Amphitheater is a great place to take a photo, enjoy a park ranger program, and relax. Walk up to the railing and check out the rock samples embedded in the posts. Touch a piece of Vishnu Schist, dating back nearly 1.8 billion years ago!<br /> <br /> From the amphitheater, follow the blacktop footpath\u00a0east, along the rim of the canyon, for 0.7 mile (1.1 km) to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/mather-point.htm\">Mather Point</a> and the Visitor Center, with parking lots 1-4.<br /> <br /> During warmer months, Park Ranger programs about geology are held here. Inquire at the Yavapai Geology Museum for more information and times.</p>",
      "audioDescription": "The Yavapai Amphitheater is located along the Rim Trail about 300 feet (90 m) east of the Yavapai Geology Museum. A 100-foot (30 m) wide, roughly semi-circular shaded seating area with a few juniper trees faces the canyon behind a four-foot (1.2 m) tall metal railing and stone pillar fence at the edge. Multiple wood log and terraced stone benches are spread out across a 100-foot (30 m) wide rocky, uneven and sloping ground of the open-air amphitheater. Two uneven stone steps lead down into the amphitheater from the trail at the west. Fifty-feet (15 m) farther east along the trail, a paved asphalt ramp leads north down a slight incline into the theater. Be mindful of a small step as you move off the path onto the dirt. As at the Yavapai Geology Museum, this location offers sweeping views of the North Rim, the inner canyon, and the Colorado River far below.",
