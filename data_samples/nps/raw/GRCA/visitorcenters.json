The visitor center itself sits on the north side of the plaza. Inside the long, glass-faced building are displays about the canyon, trip planning tools, and a park ranger-staffed information desk. At the east end, you can enter a theater, which shows two accessible park films: \u201cGrand Canyon: A Journey of Wonder\u201d and \"We Are Grand Canyon.\" A large 3-D relief map with videos features a variety of canyon locations and experiences. Adjacent to the visitor center building, to the west, are restrooms and a water filling station. Additional restrooms and a second water filling station are located to the east a short distance along the path toward the landmark Tribal Medallion and Mather Point. To the southeast of the plaza is the Grand Canyon Visitor Center shuttle bus terminal, with shuttle buses to all areas of the park. A bike rental shop and caf\u00e9 serving grab and go food is situated at the western end of the plaza, and a large Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store sits on the south side of the plaza, directly opposite the visitor center. There is a water fountain located to the left inside the store, and there are several benches out front. The Park Store features a wide variety of books, maps and gifts to help you plan your trip to Grand Canyon, learn more about its geology, ecology and human history. Park Store purchases help fund new exhibits, scientific research, trail restoration, wildlife monitoring, ecological restoration, support for the arts, Junior Ranger and education programs, and historic building preservation.",

Four evenly spaced eight-foot (2.4 m) wide arched openings extend to the left and right of the ramp, two on each side. An open deck area on the second floor spans the width of the building, with a central covered portico in front of a second-floor door. Inside, the facility features a Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store. Park ranger-conducted activities sometimes begin here, along with exhibits about the history of both the canyon and the Village. On the west side of the building sits a central information desk and check-out counter staffed by Grand Canyon Conservancy employees. A few benches are placed just to the west of the center of the room, and there is a 12-foot (3.6 m) tall by six-foot (2 m) wide limestone brick fireplace at the back of the building. Also at this location, a set of restrooms is available in a separate building outside and behind the visitor center. Facing the store at the base of the entrance ramp, turn right and move about 20 feet (6 m) to the sidewalk bordering the parking lot, and turn left. Continue 40 feet (12 m) forward to the end of the asphalt path where it meets the paved road. Being mindful of car traffic, turn left 45-degrees and move another 40 feet (12 m) forward to the restroom outbuilding. The entrance is at the far left of the building with a concrete ramp and metal railings. About six feet to the right of the concrete entrance ramp to Verkamp's Visitor Center stands a three-foot (1 m) tall rectangular limestone-block pedestal with a roughly 10-inch (25 cm) square metal plaque embedded in the top. Note a two-foot (60 cm) tall pillar of petrified wood at the base of the ramp at the right in front of the plaque. <br />Text on the plaque reads: \"Verkamp's Store has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior, 1906.\"",
