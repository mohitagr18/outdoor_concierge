When these conditions exist, federal regulations (in Yosemite) and state law (outside Yosemite) <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htm\">require that you use chains or cables</a> in order to reduce the chances of accidents. Chain requirements are strictly enforced.</p> <p>If you are visiting any location in Yosemite from November through March, you should expect chain requirements to be in effect, even if you only plan to visit Yosemite Valley and use the free shuttle. Any time chain controls are in effect,\u00a0<strong>all</strong>\u00a0vehicles must have chains in possession,\u00a0<strong><em>including four-wheel drive and rental vehicles</em>.</strong></p> <p>Chains are often required on roads both inside and outside of Yosemite from November through March, less often in October and April, and rarely in September or May. Because high-elevation roads receive more snow, chains are required on the Wawona Road (Highway 41), Big Oak Flat Road (Highway 120 from the west), and Badger Pass Road more often than on the El Portal Road (Highway 140), roads within Yosemite Valley, and the Hetch Hetchy Road.</p> <p>Call 209/372-0200 (press 1 then 1) for updated road information inside the park. This recording is updated whenever road conditions change and is the same way in which park staff gets road information. This recording includes information about current chain requirements. Remember that conditions can change rapidly.</p> <p>Keep in mind that these chain requirements are not unique to Yosemite and apply in all the mountainous regions of California. You may encounter chain controls even before you enter Yosemite. You can check on current chain requirements for the following roads outside of Yosemite:\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=41\">Highway 41</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=120\">Highway 120</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=140\">Highway 140</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=88\">Highway 88</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=50\">US 50</a>.

    "longDescription": "<p>Yosemite National Park supports more than\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/npspecies.htm\">400 species</a>\u00a0of vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The high diversity of species is the result of diverse habitats in Yosemite that are largely intact. The park\u2019s rich habitats range from thick foothill chaparral to conifer forests to expanses of alpine rock. Animals feel at home in each location.</p> <p><strong>While seeing wildlife in Yosemite can be exciting, remember that it is illegal to approach or feed\u00a0any\u00a0wild animal\u00a0in Yosemite, including birds and squirrels.</strong><br /> <br /> Wildlife can cause injuries and transmit diseases. Human food is unhealthy for wild animals. Animals used to being fed can become dangerous and be killed as a result. Stay at least 150 ft (46 m) from bears and coyotes. Stay at least 25 ft (8 m) from all other wildlife.</p> <h2>What to Do If You See a Bear</h2> <p>You may not see a bear during your visit because bears naturally avoid people. If you do see a bear, what you should do depends on the situation. In any case, always let a ranger know or leave a message at 209/372-0322. If a bear is attempting to get human food or won't leave a developed area, you can call 911.</p> <h3>Bear in a Developed Area or Approaching You</h3> <p>If a bear approaches you\u00a0<strong>or</strong>\u00a0if you are in a campground, picnic area, parking lot, lodging area, or other developed area, act immediately to scare it away. Scare the bear away by yelling aggressively and as loudly as possible until the bear leaves. The bear is intruding on your personal space: act angry and be persistent. If you are with other people, stand together to present a more intimidating figure, but do not surround the bear. While never a guarantee, these techniques are highly effective when done well. (Bear spray/pepper spray is not allowed in Yosemite.)</p> <p>If you have food out and are having trouble scaring the bear away, pack up all your food and leave the area. Throwing food at the bear or leaving food behind will only encourage its behavior and likely result in the bear's death. Never have out more food than you can control and do not leave food out of arm's reach, even for a moment. (Do not try to take back food that a bear already has.)</p> <p>The purpose of yelling aggressively is not to harm the bear, but to scare it from the area and restore its natural fear of people by providing a negative experience. Scaring a bear away, along with storing your food properly, helps keeps bears wild and alive.</p> <h3>Bear Outside Developed Areas and Not Approaching People</h3> <p>If you see a bear away from development and people, keep your distance (at least 50 yards, or about the distance four shuttle buses parked end to end would take up). If you get closer, you will be helping the bear become used to being around people.</p> <p>Bears that become comfortable around people lose their natural fear of us and sometimes become too aggressive; sometimes they then have to be killed.</p> <p>When a ranger sees a bear, the ranger may use non-lethal aversive tactics to chase the bear out of a developed area. During your visit, you may see and hear rangers patrolling public areas for bears. You may hear rangers yelling at and chasing bears. You may also see or hear rangers shooting noisemakers or non-lethal projectiles (such as rubber slugs from a shotgun or clear paintballs from a paintball gun). The intent is not to harm the bear, but to scare it from the area and restore its natural fear of people by providing a negative experience.</p> <p>NOTE: These regulations and precautions help decrease the chance of personal injury or property damage. However, bear damage and confrontations are still possible even when all of the above guidelines are followed. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in citation and/or impoundment of property.</p> <h2>Birdwatching</h2> <p>Yosemite National Park provides essential habitat for over 165 species of migrating, wintering, and breeding birds, in addition to nearly 100 species recorded as transient or vagrant. Designated a World Heritage Site and an Important Bird Area, the park harbors diverse avian assemblages and habitats, numerous bird species of special concern, and prized habitat ranging from gently sloping foothill grasslands, through chaparral/oak woodland and giant conifer forests, up to windswept alpine meadows and peaks.</p> <p>The most regularly seen resident birds include Steller's jay, American robin, acorn woodpecker, common raven, and mountain chickadee. In spring, look for the bright red wing patches on the red-winged blackbird (most often seen in wet meadows) or the tropical looking western tanager foraging in the conifers. Near rivers and streams, watch the american dipper dart in and out of rapids and listen for their beautiful melodious song.</p> <p>Some of the more sought-after birds to see in Yosemite include the great gray owl, spotted owl, peregrine falcon, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawk.</p> <p>In general, quiet forests and meadows away from developed areas (particularly in the mornings) are the best places to see some of the less common birds. Keep in mind basic birding etiquette; tread lightly and quietly and please follow park rules by refraining from using broadcast bird calls to elicit responses.<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0</span></p> <h3>More Resources for Birdwatching in Yosemite</h3> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/upload/yosebirdchecklist.pdf\">Bird checklist</a>\u00a0[343 kb PDF]</p> </li> <li> <p>To add to the park's scientific study of birds,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/utilities/sendmail/sendemail.cfm?o=5884C9BA95ECBCA89BB8188FF707B8E3419250&r=/yose/planyourvisit/birdwatching.htm\">email</a>\u00a0the park ornithologist of any unusual sightings or observed behaviors (include location details).</p> </li> <li> <p>Join a\u00a0<a href=\"https://yosemite.org/experience/birding-wildlife-walks/\">Yosemite Conservancy</a>\u00a0guide for a birding excursion!

Yosemite is not just a climber's playground, however: its walls and crags are an integral part of a larger ecosystem, protected as Wilderness, which was set aside for people to enjoy in a natural state for generations to come.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbing.htm\">Climbing in Yosemite</a> has inherent risks and climbers assume complete responsibility for their own safety. The National Park Service does not maintain routes; loose rock and other hazards can exist on any route. Rescue is not a certainty. If you get into difficulties, be prepared to get yourself out of them. Know what to do in any emergency, including injuries, evacuations, unplanned bivouacs, or rapid changes in weather. Safety depends on having the right gear and the right attitude. Practice self-rescue techniques before you need them! Courtesy is an element of safety. Falling rock or gear is a serious hazard. Be careful when climbing above others. Do not create a dangerous situation by passing another party without their consent.</p> <aside> <p>All climbers staying overnight on big wall climbs in Yosemite are required to have a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/climbingpermits.htm\">wilderness climbing permit</a>.\u00a0Wilderness climbing permits are available by self-registration, are free, and there are no quotas or limits on the number of permits available. The permit system helps climbing rangers better understand use patterns on big walls. It will also increase compliance with existing regulations (e.g., proper disposal of waste) and minimize impacts to wilderness character through improved education.</p> <p>It is illegal to camp at the base of any wall in Yosemite Valley. If you must bivouac on the summit, you are required to follow all regulations:</p> </aside> <ul> <li> <p>Do not litter, toss, or cache anything.

This quiet retreat on the west end of Yosemite Village is the final resting place of many of Yosemite's early residents. Some of those laid to rest here are well-known figures in the history of the park. Some spent their entire lives in Yosemite and are now almost forgotten. Others were visitors about whom very little was known, even at their time of their deaths.There are people who died here while on vacation, early settlers and homesteaders, old timers and infants, hotel proprietors and common laborers, each with a story. Many of these stories are entwined like strands in a rope that spans a century or more. Some stories are short and alone. Some, like those of American Indians buried here are so hidden we may never know them.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Those buried here include:</p> <ul> <li>Galen Clark, the first state-appointed guardian of Yosemite. Clark planted the sequoias that surround his grave, which have since grown tall around his resting place.</li> <li>James Mason Hutchings, the first to organize a tourist party to visit\u00a0Yosemite in 1855.\u00a0Hutchings unknowingly made an enormous contribution by hiring John Muir to work at his sawmill in 1869.</li> <li>Forest S.
