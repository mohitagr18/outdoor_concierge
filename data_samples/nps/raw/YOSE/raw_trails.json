Venturing off-trail in this area frequently leads to serious injuries.</p> <h2>Tips & Seasonal Information</h2> <p>Leashed pets are permitted on this trail. Bicycles are prohibited on the Lower Yosemite Fall loop trail. Several bicycle racks are located at the east and west end of the\u00a0Lower Yosemite Fall\u00a0loop.\u00a0A restroom along with a water bottle filling station is located near the trailhead, on the western end of the loop\u00a0across the street from Yosemite Valley Lodge.<br /> <br /> <strong>While you can visit this trail and\u00a0viewing area\u00a0year-round, there is often no water in the waterfall\u00a0by late summer.\u00a0</strong></p> <p>In winter, a cone of ice accumulates at the base of\u00a0Upper Yosemite Fall, sometimes exceeding 300\u00a0feet tall.\u00a0The ice cone\u00a0is usually melted by mid-April.\u00a0In early spring,\u00a0<a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/frazilice.htm\">frazil ice</a>\u00a0sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when waterfall mist becomes very cool.</p> <p>When waterfall flow is especially high, generally in April and May, the full moon refracting light on the waterfall mist can create a phenomenon called a moonbow. The visibility of the moonbow is highly dependent on water flow, clear skies, and angle of the moon.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>There is no designated accessible parking nearby. Visitors may use the shuttle stop to reach the trail or travel along the paved path from the accessible parking at the west end of Yosemite Village (approximately 0.3 mile\u00a0to the eastern side of the loop trail).<br /> <br /> The entire Lower Yosemite Fall loop trail is paved. The eastern part of the loop (0.6 mile\u00a0one-way\u00a0from the Yosemite Falls shuttle stop to the viewing area) is accessible to wheelchairs and crosses several braided streams before reaching the Lower Yosemite Fall viewing area, which has transferable seating to granite boulders at wheelchair height.<br /> <br /> The western part of the loop (0.5 mile\u00a0one-way to the viewing area) is wide enough for several people and is mostly accessible; however, a short, steep grade near the viewing area (the last 180 feet include a slope of 13.8%) may make assistance necessary for some visitors.<br /> <br /> Along the western portion of the loop, about halfway to the falls, a bronze relief model depicts the Yosemite Falls area. Wayside exhibits along the trail also feature bronze relief panels.<br /> <br /> An accessible restroom is located near the trailhead, on the western end of the loop\u00a0across the street from Yosemite Valley Lodge. The restroom facility has a designated family restroom that is also accessible.</p>",

The trail slopes downhill into the grove, making this a moderate hike on the return to\u00a0the parking area. An old ranger patrol cabin, the former summer retreat of park superintendents, is part of the grove's history. Look for dogwoods blooming here in the spring.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distance:\u00a0</strong>3 miles (4.8 km) round trip<br /> <strong>Elevation gain:\u00a0</strong>520-foot (158 m) on return<br /> <strong>Time estimate:\u00a0</strong>1.5-3\u00a0hours</p> <h2>Tips</h2> <p>Pets and bicycles are not allowed on this trail. A vault toilet is located near the trailhead parking area. There is no drinking water at the parking area or in the grove. Be sure to bring drinking water with you.</p> <h2>Seasonal Information</h2> <p>In winter, ski or snowshoe touring in Yosemite can be a magnificent experience! The first half mile is level and easy, providing a good warm-up for the steep 1 mile (1.6 km) descent into the grove. This trail requires heavy snowfall from a cold, lower-elevation storm to be skiable. Trails are not groomed in the Crane Flat area. Icy or crusty conditions as well as deep snow can make winter travel on trails much more difficult.</p>",

When these conditions exist, federal regulations (in Yosemite) and state law (outside Yosemite) <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htm\">require that you use chains or cables</a> in order to reduce the chances of accidents. Chain requirements are strictly enforced.</p> <p>If you are visiting any location in Yosemite from November through March, you should expect chain requirements to be in effect, even if you only plan to visit Yosemite Valley and use the free shuttle. Any time chain controls are in effect,\u00a0<strong>all</strong>\u00a0vehicles must have chains in possession,\u00a0<strong><em>including four-wheel drive and rental vehicles</em>.</strong></p> <p>Chains are often required on roads both inside and outside of Yosemite from November through March, less often in October and April, and rarely in September or May. Because high-elevation roads receive more snow, chains are required on the Wawona Road (Highway 41), Big Oak Flat Road (Highway 120 from the west), and Badger Pass Road more often than on the El Portal Road (Highway 140), roads within Yosemite Valley, and the Hetch Hetchy Road.</p> <p>Call 209/372-0200 (press 1 then 1) for updated road information inside the park. This recording is updated whenever road conditions change and is the same way in which park staff gets road information. This recording includes information about current chain requirements. Remember that conditions can change rapidly.</p> <p>Keep in mind that these chain requirements are not unique to Yosemite and apply in all the mountainous regions of California. You may encounter chain controls even before you enter Yosemite. You can check on current chain requirements for the following roads outside of Yosemite:\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=41\">Highway 41</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=120\">Highway 120</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=140\">Highway 140</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=88\">Highway 88</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=50\">US 50</a>.

      "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"http://www.travelyosemite.com/winter/yosemite-ski-snowboard-area/\">Badger Pass Ski Area</a>\u00a0is located on the Glacier Point Road (also known as the Badger Pass Road in winter) five miles (8 km) east of the junction with the Wawona Road (continuation of Highway 41). The base of the ski area is at 7,200 feet (2,200 m).\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htm\">Chains</a>\u00a0are often required on the roads leading to Badger Pass. Beyond Badger Pass, the Glacier Point Road is closed to car traffic and is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing.</p> <p>Badger Pass is home to the oldest downhill skiing area in California. Following a surge in interest in winter sports, the west\u2019s first ski lift, called an Upski, was built in 1933. The lift looked more like a large multi-person sled pulled by cables, but people were delighted. The historic lodge opened a few years later in 1935.</p> <p>Today, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.travelyosemite.com/winter/badger-pass-ski-area/\">Badger Pass Ski Area</a>\u00a0offers downhill skiing and snowboarding from mid-December through March (conditions permitting). The Upski has been replaced with chair lifts, but people still love to relax on the deck of the historic lodge to watch people carving the slopes.</p>",
