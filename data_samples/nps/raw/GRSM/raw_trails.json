      "bodyText": "<p>Human history in Cades Cove started long before the 1800s. Humans have been using the land in this area for thousands of years. The earliest artifact collected in the park is a lithic dated to 7000 BCE. Though they may not have built structures in Cades Cove that are present today, the impact of the Cherokee is felt throughout the cove. Many trails created by the Cherokee are still traveled by visitors hiking or driving today. One of these trails is now Rich Mountain Road which connected the cove to the Tuckaleechee area. Many settlers followed in the Cherokees\u2019 footsteps and used this route and others to reach Cades Cove. The Cherokee, like settlers after them, cut logs for structures and fires. They cleared land for agriculture, and they hunted, foraged, and traded or bought what they didn\u2019t grow themselves. In the early 1810-1820s, Sequoyah developed the Cherokee syllabary, a written version of the Cherokee language.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee name for Cades Cove is Tsiyahi, \u201cOtter Place.\u201d Otters were found throughout the many creeks and streams in the cove, but they were extirpated from this area in the 1920s, after being hunted and trapped for their valuable pelts. The park reintroduced them in the 1980s and they have made a remarkable comeback. Today they are often seen near Abrams Falls. The name \u201cAbrams\u201d stems from Cherokee Chief Abram or Abraham, known as Ooskuah to the Cherokee. The origin of the name \u201cCade\u201d also likely came from Cherokee Chief Cade (or Kade) from this area. A \u201ccove\u201d is a flat valley between mountains or ridges.<br /> <br /> Most of the Cherokee living in the Southeastern United States were forcibly removed starting with the Indian Removal Act in 1830 which offered territory in Oklahoma in exchange for land in this region. In 1835 the Treaty of New Echota ceded most of the Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi to the federal government. These actions resulted in the \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d in 1938, where 16,000 Cherokee\u00a0were forced to walk 1,200 miles west. Thousands died in the process. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee who live on the Qualla Boundary adjacent to the park today are the descendants of the few who remained, escaped, or those who returned. A visit to Cherokee, North Carolina offers visitors an opportunity to learn more about Cherokee history and culture.<br /> <br /> Typically, when a national park or protected area is created, many spaces that people lived in and used are returned to nature. In Cades Cove, this idea is blended with historic preservation. Cades Cove has far fewer buildings than it did at peak settlement around 1900 with over 700 residents. Instead of agricultural fields, today there are grasses and native plants. The cove is actively managed using mowing and prescribed fire to keep trees and woody shrubs at bay. If the cove wasn\u2019t managed this way, it would revert to forest in most areas and look very similar to the woods found throughout the park.</p>",

      "bodyText": "<h3>Overview</h3> <p>Elijah Oliver was born in 1824 to John and Lucretia Oliver. Although he spent most of his life living in the cove, he did leave during the Civil War, relocating to Tuckaleechee Cove to escape attacks from Confederate supporters and rebel groups out of North Carolina. Attacks were devastating for the Cades Cove community. In 1850, Cades Cove had over 600 settlers, but the population plummeted to under 300 in the war era. Many settlers returned, but it took time for Cades Cove to recover to pre-war population levels.<br /> <br /> Elijah and his family did return to Cades Cove after the war and bought property in 1865 for a farmstead. The cabin that Elijah Oliver\u2019s family lived in was a dog trot style cabin which consists of two cabins that were connected by a breezeway and shared a common roof. Along with the dog trot style cabin, Elijah Oliver\u2019s homestead would eventually include a corn crib, smokehouse, springhouse, and barn. The springhouse was built over a trickling spring to ensure clean water for the family. The spring\u2019s cool temperature was also harnessed to extend the life of perishables such as eggs, milk, and butter. The springhouse is a unique feature since it is the only one remaining in the cove.<br /> <br /> Another unique feature of the Elijah Oliver place is the stranger room. This room is located off the front porch and was built to house overnight visitors. The room allowed the family to accommodate visitors, but in an area separate from the family\u2019s space. Stranger rooms were fairly common in the cove. The hospitable spirit that inspired their existence endures into modern times as visitors come to enjoy the stories and the legacies of the settlers that once lived here.</p> <h3>How to Get There</h3> <ul> <li>Walk half a mile on the Elijah Oliver Place Access Trail after parking at the paved pullout\u00a0(just past Cooper Road Trailhead), roughly 5 miles (8 km) into the loop drive. Continue walking straight past the Wet Bottom Trail junction.\u00a0Expect to find a wide, gradual incline with some areas of dirt, gravel, rocks, roots, uneven surface, and one stream crossing on the way to the cabin. Turn around after reaching Elijah Oliver Place.</li> <li>The Cades Cove Loop Road is 11 miles, one way, and typically takes at least 3 hours to drive through.</li> </ul> <h3>Similar Points of Interest</h3> <ul> <li>Other historic structures in Cades Cove</li> </ul> <h3>Accessibility\u00a0</h3> <p>This section of trail has been assessed using the High-Efficiency Trail Assessment Process (HETAP) to provide objective information such as grade and slope.

The tower is listed on the\u00a0National Register of Historic Places\u00a0and is a significant example of\u00a0National Park Service Modern architecture, a style that marked a departure from the traditional rustic \"parkitecture\" aesthetic.</p> <p>The tower also holds historical importance as part of the\u00a0Mission 66\u00a0program\u2014a major National Park Service initiative from\u00a01955 to 1966\u00a0that transformed park planning, management, and architecture. While the program led to the construction of hundreds of buildings and structures, only\u00a0nine observation towers\u00a0were built. Kuwohi Observation Tower is one of these rare structures and served as the\u00a0prototype\u00a0for two later Mission 66 towers:<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/look-rock-tower-trail.htm\">\u00a0Look Rock Tower</a>\u00a0in the Great Smoky Mountains and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/shark-valley-observation-tower.htm\">Shark Valley Observation Tower</a>\u00a0in the Everglades.</p> <p>Check out the view from a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/webcams.htm?site=grcd\">webcam</a>.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/kuwohi.htm\">Hike to Kuwohi</a><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem; font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0on a steep, short, paved trail from Kuwohi parking area.</span></p> <h2>Similar Point\u00a0of Interest</h2> <p><a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/thingstodo/look-rock-tower-trail.htm\">Hike\u00a0to Look Rock Tower</a></p>",

Visitors can now enjoy family-style meals and basic amenities\u00a0away from the hustle and bustle of modern life.<br /> <br /> Mount LeConte is the third highest peak in Great Smoky Mountains National Park at 6,593 feet (2,010 m). LeConte Lodge predates the national park\u2019s 1934 establishment and is located west of the summit at 6,360 feet (1,939 m).</p> <h2>Brief History</h2> <p>Paul Adams established a tent camp atop Mount LeConte in 1925 when the movement to establish a national park in the Smokies was in full swing. Jack Huff, the lodge\u2019s founder and a Gatlinburg mountaineer, began constructing the rustic retreat in 1926. Jack, along with wife Pauline and their family, operated the lodge until 1960. Huff built many of the existing buildings still used today. From 1960 to 1975, Herrick and Myrtle Brown owned and operated the lodge. Jim Huff, Hugh Ogle, and Bill Rinearson shared ownership of the lodge from 1976 to 1989. The Stokely family began its tenure of lodge ownership and operational oversight in 1989. It is currently a limited partnership between Stokely Hospitality Enterprises and Tim Line. <a href=\"https://lecontelodge.com/about/\">Learn more</a> about the lodge\u2019s history and <a href=\"https://lecontelodge.com/reservations/\">make reservations</a> on the LeConte Lodge website.</p> <h2>Lodge Access</h2> <h3>The five hiking routes to the lodge vary in length from 5 to 8 miles one-way.</h3> <ul> <li>Alum Cave Trail</li> <li>Boulevard Trail via the Appalachian Trail</li> <li>Bullhead Trail</li> <li>Rainbow Falls Trail</li> <li>Trillium Gap Trail</li> </ul> <h2>Reservations</h2> <p>The lodge is generally open from mid-March through mid-November.\u00a0<a href=\"https://lecontelodge.com/reservations/\">Advance reservations</a> are required to stay at the lodge.</p>",

Before it became the largest campground in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Elkmont was the second largest town in Sevier County. By 1918, the town had over 1,500 residents and was considered a \u201ccompany town\u201d built by the Little River Lumber Company and Railroad in 1908. The company owned almost 80,000 acres of what is now the national park. Elkmont\u2019s strategic location (halfway between Clingmans Dome and the town of Townsend) made it economical to transport cut trees by railroad to the sawmill in Townsend, then off to markets around the world. \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{54}\" paraid=\"815106061\">Standing at the present-day yield sign on your left, look down the road to your right where the walk-in tent sites are located. Using the photograph circa 1917/18, try to imagine Elkmont\u2019s former Main Street or Rail Street where a single railroad track ran 18 miles from Townsend. The track was divided into three tracks for the short length of the town of Elkmont. (You are standing at the bottom right corner of the photo. The flat straight drive was built directly on the old railroad bed.) The town consisted of a commissary (company store), church, school, hotel, tavern, machine shop, and employee houses. Not long after the town opened, Little River Lumber Company leased the land east of Elkmont town to the Appalachian Club of Knoxville, and west of town to the Wonderland Club.\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{122}\" paraid=\"646166563\">By 1925, the lumber company finished logging the area, pulled up all the rails, closed the town, and started logging the area known as Tremont.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{132}\" paraid=\"131947901\">It is hard to believe that just over 100 years ago this area was a bustling town of over 1,500 residents. \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{146}\" paraid=\"1744571511\">As you travel between stops, look for signs of the people who came before us, watch for distinct gaps in the forest which could indicate the route of an old railroad bed, or consider the size and type of trees around you. Learning to read the landscape can reveal clues about a time gone by\u2026\u00a0</p>",

      "bodyText": "<p>A short drive down Forge Creek Road leads to the Henry Whitehead Place, a uniquely built home and the last example of a sawn log house in the park. The story of this home begins with the smaller cabin in the back. This cabin is simple, but visitors today might notice the \u2018granny hole\u2019 by the fireplace. It provided the person tending the fire with a window outside. This one room cabin was built roughly and quickly out of necessity for Matilda Shields by her brothers in 1881. Matilda and her young son were abandoned by her husband during a visit to see family in Cades Cove. Around the same time, Henry Whitehead lost his wife and became a single father to three young daughters. He and Matilda married in 1887, and he built the larger home in the front between 1895-1898.<br /> <br /> This home is often mistaken for a frame structure because it is built of logs that were run through a sawmill and \u201csquared up,\u201d resulting in a smooth, consistent appearance. You can compare this construction to the more common hewn log structure of the original cabin where logs were roughly flattened by hand. Since the logs were irregular shapes, the spaces between the logs had to be filled, or chinked, with mud or clay. With a sawn log building like the Henry Whitehead cabin, the logs fit together so well that almost no chinking was required resulting in a well-insulated home. These two cabins are connected by a covered passageway and serve as an architectural link between the different construction types in Cades Cove.<br /> <br /> The outbuilding next to the cabin is a smokehouse, one of five remaining in Cades Cove today. The floor of the smokehouse was often kept as dirt, on which the fire could be built. Freshly cut oak or hickory wood was often used, but water could also be added to older wood to increase smoke production. Smokehouses have interior shelves on which the smoked hams and other meats could be stored for later use. In Cades Cove, the meat was almost always pork because hogs were inexpensive to feed and easy to raise. Smokehouses were typically constructed close to the house for convenience and to provide protection from bears which were attracted by the smell of smoked meats. The structures needed to be sturdy and well-sealed to keep out wildlife, but also to keep in the smoke used for preservation. Storing food safely from wildlife has always been an important challenge and is one people still face today.<br /> <br /> The Henry Whitehead place stands alone today, but during its occupation, homes lined Forge Creek Road. There were other large sawed-log houses built by Frederick Shields and James V. Cable, but unfortunately, these buildings were not preserved. This road also leads to another road, Parson Branch Road, which you can drive during the warmer months. This one-way, unpaved, high clearance road leads to Highway 129 and travels through the former area of the Chestnut Flats community. Return to the Cades Cove Loop Road via Forge Creek Road to continue the Auto Tour.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Drive the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road.\u00a0The Henry Whitehead place is located 0.75 miles down Forge Creek Road.

Like residents of all counties bordering the park, Swain County families experienced emotional loss in the 1930s when they had to leave their homes and farms to make way for the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Hardly a decade later, in 1942 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fontana-dam.htm\">Fontana Dam\u2019s</a> construction by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began and forced some Swain County families who had relocated outside of the park boundaries to relocate yet again. TVA purchased some tracts of land and forced residents of others out by eminent domain. TVA constructed Fontana Dam by wartime necessity to generate electricity for Oak Ridge, TN and the top-secret <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mapr/planyourvisit/oakridge-tn.htm\">Manhattan Project</a>. Construction of the hydroelectric dam was completed in 1945. With the dam in place, the Little Tennessee River was flooded, and Fontana Lake was formed over an area previously inhabited by over 1,000 residents in the towns of Proctor, Judson, Fontana and surrounding areas.<br /> <br /> In 1943, the 44,170 acres of land acquired by TVA for the construction of Fontana Dam and the subsequent formation of Fontana Lake was transferred to the Department of the Interior and incorporated into Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The same agreement that facilitated this land transfer also included a provision to construct Lakeview Drive along the north shore of the newly formed lake. This road was intended to reconnect displaced residents with cemeteries and other important community sites that were now located across the 17-mile-long Fontana Lake.Construction of Lakeview Drive, then known as North Shore Road, began in the 1960s. However, due to slope instability, high costs, and significant environmental challenges, the project was halted in 1972 and never completed. In 2007, the National Park Service agreed to a $52 million cash settlement with Swain County to honor the original 1943 agreement regarding the road\u2019s completion. The federal government fulfilled the settlement payments in full by 2017.<br /> <br /> The road now serves as a scenic getaway that showcases footprints of homesteads still honored by descendants and highlights the sacrifice of these communities to the formation of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the construction of Fontana Dam.</p> <h3>Detailed Directions\u00a0</h3> <p>From the Swain County Visitor Center and Heritage Museum in downtown Bryson City, follow Everett Street north and continue on Fontana Road for about 2.5 miles until you reach Lakeview Drive entrance.<br /> Mile 3.2: Fontana Lake Overlook has 8 parking spaces, 1 picnic table, and 1 trash can.<br /> Mile 5.0: Access to Noland Creek Trail and Benton McKaye Trail with 21 parking spaces.<br /> Mile 5.4: No trail access, 6 parking spaces.<br /> Mile 5.7: Access to Lakeview Drive Tunnel, Tunnel Bypass Trail, Goldmine Loop Trail, and Lakeshore Trail with 12 parking spaces.</p> <h3>Length\u00a0</h3> <p>11.4 miles (18.3 km) roundtrip</p> <h3>Parking\u00a0</h3> <p><a>Parking availability varies by overlook. </a>Don\u2019t forget <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">your parking tag</a>.</p> <h3>Nearest Restroom\u00a0</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/deep-creek-picnic-area.htm\">Deep Creek Picnic Area (open seasonally)</a></p> <h2>Similar Routes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-cosby-to-i-40.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Cosby to I-40)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-chilhowee-to-walland.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Chilhowee to Walland)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-walland-to-wears-valley.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Walland to Wears Valley)</a><br /> \u00a0</p>",
