At the time I had no idea what a great decision I had made.\n\nStraddling North Carolina and Tennessee, the park encompasses 815 square miles of unspoiled Appalachia. It is, astoundingly, the [most visited National Park in the USA](https://www.npca.org/articles/1480-the-10-most-visited-parks-and-less-visited-side-trips).\n\nAlthough there are several roads in the park, it\u2019s bisected by only one paved road. That\u2019s a 30+-mile stretch of US 441 between the kitschy towns of Cherokee, NC and [Gatlinburg, TN](https://www.gatlinburg.com/). But don\u2019t let the short distance of this scenic drive in the Smoky Mountains fool you; it normally takes a few hours to drive across. That\u2019s due to its numerous twists and turns, as well as the frequent stops most people make to admire the scenery, flora and fauna.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Easy to Take This Smoky Mountains\u2019 Scenic Drive](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-easy-to-take-this-smoky-mountains-scenic-drive)\n- [Incredible Flora and Fauna on this Smoky Mountains Scenic Drive](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-incredible-flora-and-fauna-on-this-smoky-mountains-scenic-drive)\n- [A Stop For Elk](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-a-stop-for-elk)\n- [Blue Ridge Parkway Through North Carolina](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-blue-ridge-parkway-through-north-carolina)\n- [A Stop at the Stables and Chimney Tops in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-a-stop-at-the-stables-and-chimney-tops-in-the-smoky-mountains)\n  - [If You Go:](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/scenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains#h-if-you-go)\n\n![people visiting a rustic farmstead - seen on a scenic drive in the Smoky mountains](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC06797-cabin.jpg)Farmstead in the National Park\n\n## Easy to Take This Smoky Mountains\u2019 Scenic Drive\n\nI started my Smoky Mountains drive on the North Carolina side. I was soon passing several carloads of families. Many had stopped to take photos of their children in front of the large park entrance sign.\n\nA way up the road I pulled into the [Oconaluftee Visitor Center](https://visitcherokeenc.com/itinerary-builder/poi/park-visitor-center/). It\u2019s the park center that showcases the culture of the region. The other visitor center, [Sugarlands](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm) on the Tennessee side, focuses on the geography and nature of the area.\n\nI spoke with a park ranger, a retired schoolteacher from Florida, who was exceptionally helpful. She told me a lot about the park and showed me on a map the popular places to go. I loaded myself up with numerous maps and brochures but before leaving headed out back to the mountain farm. The Ranger had urged me to visit it and I found it was well worth the half-hour diversion.\n\n![cars in a forest - seen on a scenic drive in the Smoky mountains](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC06962-cars-800.jpg)\n\n## Incredible Flora and Fauna on this Smoky Mountains Scenic Drive\n\nMy first stop after leaving the center was at the [Mingus Mill](https://www.greatsmokies.com/mingus-mill/). It\u2019s a mill that ground corn into meal and wheat into flour for more than 50 years for the mountain community near Mingus Creek.\n\n![wild ping flowers in the forest - seen on a scenic drive in the Smoky mountains](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC06810-flowers-300.jpg)\n\nTo get to it from the little parking lot you take a five-minute walk on a trail through woods. All about are huge rhododendrons reaching up beneath a tall canopy of trees.\n\nThere are [100 species of native trees in the Great Smoky Mountains](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/trees-shrubs-list.htm), more than in all of northern Europe. There\u2019s also an extensive variety of other flora and fauna.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, scientists currently know only about 17 percent of the plants and animals that live in the park, or about 17,000 species of probably 100,000 different organisms.\n\n![a woman taking a photo of an elk grazing - seen on a scenic drive in the Smoky mountains](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC07111-woman-and-elk-2.jpg)Elk on Route 441 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n## A Stop For Elk\n\nOn a Smoky Mountains road trip you can see many things right from your car. Walking the numerous trails, however, even for a short distance, provides a much richer experience. Hiking is popular in this park. In fact, the famed [Appalachian Trail](https://hikinginthesmokys.com/appalachian-trail-guide/), stretching from Georgia to Maine, threads its way the length of it. You can also enjoy bicycling and horseback riding. Pressed for time, though, I spent a good deal of my day in the car. And after leaving Mingus Mill, I headed further into the forest.\n\nAt one point I came around a bend, found a line of cars stopped and thought there was an accident. Then I realized that many of the people were getting out of their cars were taking pictures. I pulled to the side, got out and found several elk grazing in a broad flower-dappled meadow. It was an incredible sight. Moreover, I was amazed at how close they grazed to the road. They were unperturbed by the numerous cars and people walking about snapping photos.\n\n![](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSCN5220-Grist-Mill.jpg)A Grist Mill along the Blue Ridge Parkway\n\n## Blue Ridge Parkway Through North Carolina\n\n[US 441 is the southern terminus of the famous 469-mile-long Blue Ridge Parkway](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/blue-ridge-parkway-drive), a two-lane road that cuts through the verdant forest as it meanders up to Virginia. Thankfully, there are frequent cutouts all along the way, where you can stop and admire the beauty all around you. Although the highway is exceptionally winding, I found that to be an asset since the slower pace provided more time to appreciate all you see on your Smoky Mountains road trip.\n\nSince the road crosses the peaks of the Smoky Mountains, for the first half of your ride you\u2019re headed uphill, and downhill once you reach the top. Near the peak at [Newfound Gap](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/nfg.htm) there\u2019s a large, popular turnout providing beautiful vistas over the mountains. When I got there though, it was totally fogged in (although still surprisingly crowded) so I moved on down the road a quarter of a mile and found another beautiful view under the clouds, all along the way admiring the patches of Black-eyed Susans that poked their heads up out of the roadside greenery.\n\n## A Stop at the Stables and Chimney Tops in the Smoky Mountains\n\n![](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC06884-stables.jpg)The Park\u2019s stables\n\nThe day was overcast and at the higher elevations every now and then wisps of clouds would drift out of the forest and float across in front of me. I passed the National Park Stables and got out for a short walk.\n\nNot long after, when I found myself driving along a ridge in a light mist with clouds on both sides, I pulled into a cutout and was surprised to find two people sitting in lawn chairs next to their car, just watching the changing vista all about them.\n\nThe Ranger at the visitor center had told me about [Chimney Tops](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/chimney-tops-trail) Picnic Area on the Gatlinburg side of the mountains. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have a picnic try to stop there,\u201d she advised me. \u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful site with large rocks in the stream.\u201d\n\nWhen I spied the sign for the picnic area I turned up the short road and immediately realized what she meant. Large boulders peppered the riverbed and along the banks people were sitting and admiring the beauty of the pastoral Appalachian scene. There were picnic tables and parking spots all along the trail, and a sign warning \u201cBear Habitat \u2013 do not leave food unattended.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t see any bears but found myself wishing I had brought a picnic along for the trip. It would have been well worth delaying my journey a bit for the experience.\n\n* * *\n\n**You may also enjoy:** [Asheville, NC \u2013 Not Your Typical Small Southern City\u00a0 /](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/things-to-do-in-asheville-nc) [Planning For A Road Trip](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/planning-for-a-road-trip) and [Top Things to Do in Charleston, SC](https://www.neverstoptraveling.com/top-things-to-do-in-charleston-sc)\n\n### If You Go:\n\n**Great Smoky Mountains National Park**\n\n[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm](http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm)\n\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neverstoptraveling.com%2Fscenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains)\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Great+Smoky+Mountains+Road+Trip&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neverstoptraveling.com%2Fscenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains&via=NeverStopTravel)\n\n[Pin](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neverstoptraveling.com%2Fscenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains)\n\n[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neverstoptraveling.com%2Fscenic-drives-in-the-smoky-mountains)\n\n0 Shares\n\n### Comments\n\n1.

The park has more than %{800\\_miles} of trails to explore, and there's something for everyone. There are sweeping mountain views, streams, rivers, and waterfalls, diverse wildlife, wildflowers, fall foliage, and more! Plus, almost %{72\\_miles} of the famous Appalachian Trail runs through the park along the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. We've picked some can't-miss hikes in the Smokies, whether you want to summit a mountain, take a gentle stroll to a waterfall, or go for a scenic drive and snap photos of wildlife.\n\nThe park is open 24 hours a day, year-round. Each season has its advantages. Summer is the most popular time to visit, when the weather is warm and sunny. Fall brings gorgeous changing leaves and cooler temperatures that are ideal for hiking. Winter keeps the crowds at bay, but most of the park is still accessible if you don't mind the colder temperatures. Spring can be wet and stormy, but there's an equal chance of beautiful weather and wildflowers pop up throughout the park.\n\nA [parking tag](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/fees.htm#11/35.5959/-83.4988) is required to park anywhere in the national park for longer than 15 minutes. You can purchase a parking tag online in advance or in person at several locations within the park.\n\nThere is no entrance fee to visit Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\n## Top trails\n\n1. ### [\\#1 \\- Cades Cove Loop Road](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/cades-cove-loop-road)\n\n\n\n[4.6(2540)\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b7Easy\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b710.5 mi\\\\\n\\\\\n\u00b7Est. 4\u20134.5 hr](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/cades-cove-loop-road \"Cades Cove Loop Road\") [This road through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park runs through a lush valley, see wildlife & historic buildings.

[Construction started](https://www.nps.gov/blri/learn/historyculture/construction.htm) on the parkway in the **1930\u2019s** as a depression-era public works project, and took over fifty years to complete. Connecting the Shenandoah National Park and The Smokies was a huge undertaking and many standards for engineering and design were pioneered during this feat.\n\n[The Blue Ridge Parkway\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/blue-ridge-parkway-500.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/blue-ridge-parkway/)\n\n## Blue Ridge Parkway\n\nFor **scenic drives in the Smoky Mountains**, the Blue Ridge Parkway winds through 469 miles of beautiful forest and mountain terrain between Shenandoah National Park and the [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/). The scenery is outstanding and there are many [recreational activities to do along the way](https://www.pigeonforge.com/road-trip-stops/); picnic area, hiking trails, camp grounds and visitor centers are just a few. There are also [restaurants](https://www.pigeonforge.com/restaurants/) and lodging along Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\n> ![](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/themes/csgm-pigeon-forge/img/left.WEBP)The idea is to fit the Parkway into the mountains as if nature has put it there.![](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/themes/csgm-pigeon-forge/img/right.WEBP)Stanley Abbott, Chief Landscape Architect\n\n## Parkway By Motorcycle\n\nFor many of Blue Ridge Parkways visitors, **the summer season is their favorite** to enjoy the slow paced scenic drive. The summer blooms along the Parkway are beyond comparison. Meadows of black eyed susan, coreopsis, queen Anne\u2019s Lace and butterfly weed line the road. Being designed as a recreational roadway, the Blue Ridge Parkway not only has beautiful scenery, but the 469 miles, including campgrounds, picnic tables, and more, is an excellent to spend a summer day or longer! Certainly one of the best scenic drives in the Smoky Mountains!\n\n[Cades Cove\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/cades-cove-sign-500.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/cades-cove/)\n\n## Cades Cove Loop\n\nMost of the settler\u2019s homes and home sites that can be viewed in [Cades Cove](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/cades-cove/) will be outside of the road you as you travel the [Cades Cove loop](https://www.pigeonforge.com/scenic-routes-in-the-smoky-mountains/). To the center of the loop will be acre upon acre of grass and wildflower fields which were once cleared by frontiersmen for valuable land used for growing things such as wheat, corn and cattle.\n\n[Cades Cove](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/cades-cove/)\n\nNearly all the buildings built by the pioneers and preserved by the Great Smoky Mountain National Park are outside the Cades Cove Loop. These remaining original structures, as well as abundant wildlife, are easy to spot as you travel the loop. [History buffs](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/historic-park-sites/) should check out the [list of historical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_structures_maintained_by_the_Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park#/Cades_Cove) maintained by the National Park, many that are accessible by Cades Cove Loop.\n\n**Directions to Cades Cove**: _From Pigeon Forge_: Turn at Traffic light #3 onto Wears Valley Road and take 321 to Townsend. Turn Left onto highway 73 and go until you see a sign for Cades Cove where you will turn right onto Laurel Creek Rd. This road runs straight into [Cades Cove](https://www.pigeonforge.com/fall-drives/). _From Gatlinburg_: Take 441 toward the National Park and Turn at the Sugarlands Visitor Center. From here you will take Little River Road to Laurel Creek Rd which runs straight into Cades Cove.\n\n[Foothills Parkway\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/foothills1.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/foothills-parkway/)\n\n## Foothills Parkway\n\n[The Foothills Parkway](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/foothills-parkway/) has been under construction since 1944, but has been stalled numerous times by funding, making it the oldest unfinished highway project in Tennessee. [When completed](https://www.nps.gov/transportation/pdfs/Foothills_Parkway_MP_Final.pdf), the 71 mile parkway will connect US Route 129 in the west with I-40 in the east. The [missing link](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/foothills-parkway/) was completed in 2018.\n\n[Foothills Parkway](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/foothills-parkway/)\n\nPeople can ride their bikes or their horses in from Wears Valley down a four mile stretch until it dead ends at the Missing Link of the parkway, or in from the Walland side and travel nine miles until it deads end as well. There is a rugged 1.25 miles in between the two roads and it is closed to bikes and horses, and not suggested for hikers.\n\n[The Foothills Parkway](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/foothills-parkway/) is the only road passable by school bus to the community known as the [Top Of The World, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_World,_Tennessee). The longest stretch of drivable road on the parkway is 16.5 mile leg that travels along the western side of **Chilhowee Mountain** in Blount County and connects US-129 with US Route 321 in Cosby. There are two other sections of drivable road on the parkway. The Gatlinburg Bypass that runs along the eastern side of Cove Mountain between Pigeon Forge and the [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/) is one stretch of the drivable nature trail. Another is a 6-mile stretch over Green Mountain in Cocke County, connecting US-321 with I-40 in the Pigeon River Valley. All of these stretches of road provide excellent views of the Great Smoky Mountains and are enjoyable scenic drives.\n\n[Tail Of The Dragon\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/tail-of-the-dragon-500-1.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/tail-of-the-dragon/)\n\n## The Tail Of The Dragon\n\nA world-renowned scenic road connecting Tennessee to North Carolina is US Highway 129. The highway is commonly referred to as [The Tail of the Dragon](https://www.pigeonforge.com/tail-of-the-dragon/). Driving the 11 mile road is very curvy, difficult and challenging for most people.\u00a0There are 318 curves in the 11 mile journey. Performance drivers rate this as the #1 motorcycle and sports car road in the US.\n\n[Tail Of The Dragon](https://www.pigeonforge.com/tail-of-the-dragon/)\n\nEven though the [Tail of the Dragon](https://www.pigeonforge.com/tail-of-the-dragon/) is a Federal Highway (US 129) which is free and open for the public to enjoy at any time, most motorcyclists and car enthusiasts from around the world say, _\u201cThis is not a road for leisure drivers.\u201d_\n\nFrom the main Parkway Pigeon Forge, TN take Wears Valley Road (Hwy. 321) approx. 15 miles toward Walland, TN. Before arriving in Walland, TN get on\u00a0Foothills Parkway and travel approx. 8 miles. Turn left onto Hwy 129 going toward Robbinsville, NC and you will find yourself on \u201cThe Tail of the Dragon.\u201d\u00a0You may continue on Hwy 129 for a few miles before entering the curvy \u201cTail of the Dragon\u201d section. Drivers have opportunities to pull over at scenic areas alongside Chilhowee Lake before entering the most difficult section of Hwy 129. Folks who continue onward along this challenging scenic road which concludes Robbinsville, NC are often referred to as \u201cdragon slayers.\u201d\n\nBalsam Mountain, Great Smoky Mountains National Park - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Smokies Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGgSN2xOftPusuRNvpnVLaA?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pigeonforge.com%2Fsmoky-mountain-activities%2Fscenic-drives%2F)\n\nSmokies Life\n\n12.2K subscribers\n\n[Balsam Mountain, Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A1jpSAzopg)\n\nSmokies Life\n\nSearch\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

To get to [Balsam Mountain Road](https://www.pigeonforge.com/scenic-routes-in-the-smoky-mountains/), take the Blue Ridge Parkway for eleven miles until the turn off for Balsam Mountain Campground. From here it is nine miles to the campground with spectacular overlooks along the way. One more mile down the road from the campground is Mile-High Heintooga Picnic Area and overlook. Buses, motorhomes, vans longer than 25 feet, and passenger vehicles towing trailers are prohibited on this road.\n\nFrom Heintooga there is an opportunity to go back the way you came, or to return to Cherokee by way of Balsam Mountain Road. The first 18 miles of this road are unpaved and the entire is trip is one-way, but it is fine for passenger vehicles. It will take roughly an hour to get to Cherokee on this scenic road.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*US 441/Newfound Gap Road is closed on the TN side between Sugarlands and Newfound Gap due to a landslide and washout. The NC side between Cherokee and Newfound Gap remains open.**\n\n[Newfound Gap\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/newfound-gap-500.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/newfound-gap/)\n\n## Newfound Gap Road\n\nAt 5,046 feet, Newfound Gap is the **lowest drivable pass** through the [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/). With an elevation of 5,046 feet, it was measured by Arnold Henry Guyot in 1872. Guyot used a barometer to measure changes in air pressure to mark the height of gaps, passes, valleys and mountains in the Smoky Mountains.\n\n[Newfound Gap](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/newfound-gap/)\n\nWhen the Pass was discovered, it replaced Indian Gap as the lowest drivable pass, hence the name [Newfound Gap](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/newfound-gap/). The road through the drivable pass is named Newfound Gap Road. To the south of Newfound Gap is Clingmans Dome Road. A seven mile drive that will get you within 0.5 miles of [Clingmans Dome](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/clingmans-dome/), **the highest peak in the Smokies**.\n\nAt nearly a mile high, Newfound Gap is significantly cooler than the surrounding lowlands and receives much more snow. It is said that a trip over the gap is like going from Georgia to Maine in terms of foliage and the variety of the forest ecosystems. When starting from either [Gatlinburg](https://www.pigeonforge.com/plan-your-visit/gatlinburg/), TN or Cherokee, NC, travelers will climb 3,000 feet, ascending through cove hardwood, pine-oak, and northern hardwood forest, to get to the evergreen spruce fir forest at Newfound Gap, that more closely resembles a forest found in New England or Canada.\n\n[Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail\\\\\n![Scenic Drives in the Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/roaring-fork-creek.jpg)](https://www.pigeonforge.com/roaring-fork-motor-nature-trail/)\n\n## Roaring Fork Motor Trail\n\n[Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail](https://www.pigeonforge.com/roaring-fork-motor-nature-trail/) is a favorite scenic drives in \u00a0the [Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/). It offers views of old-growth forests, historic cabins, and rushing mountain streams. The Roaring Fork Motor Trail is a narrow six mile stretch of **twists and turns**. Though it is paved, motorhomes, buses, and trailers are not permitted on the trail.\n\n[Roaring Fork](https://www.pigeonforge.com/roaring-fork-motor-nature-trail/)\n\nThe road runs beside beautiful views of forest, [waterfalls](https://www.pigeonforge.com/top-4-waterfalls-in-the-smokies/), and mountain streams. To get to Roaring Fork, turn at traffic light #8 off the main parkway in Gatlinburg, TN and continue along the [Historic Nature Trail](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/nature-info/) to the Cherokee Orchard entrance to the national park.\n\n![Scenic Drives In The Smoky Mountains](https://www.pigeonforge.com/wp-content/uploads/cataloochee-valley-500.jpg)\n\n## Cataloochee\n\nOnce one of the largest communities in the Smoky Mountains, this mountain valley was home to some 1,200 people in 1910. While some families boarded tourists, agriculture was the primary source of income. Visitors will be able to view many [historical buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_structures_maintained_by_the_Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park) in Cataloochee, including two churches, a school, and many homes which have been preserved to give an idea of life in the valley 100 years ago.\n\nAccess to Cataloochee requires driving down a **well-maintained gravel road** for two miles. To get there just take the Blue Ridge Parkway to Highway 19. Follow 19 (toward Asheville) through Maggie Valley. Turn left onto Highway 276 N. Just before the entrance ramp to I-40 (but past the gas station), turn left and follow the signs 11 more miles to Cataloochee.\n\nTurkey, elk, deer, and [other wildlife](https://www.pigeonforge.com/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/nature-info/) also always seems to be on display in Catloochee for visitors to view, and your best chance to see this wildlife is, like other areas in the park, in the morning and evenings around open fields.\n\n### You Might Also Like\n\n[**Gregory Bald and the Flame Azaleas**](https://www.pigeonforge.com/gregorys-bald-and-the-flame-azaleas/)\n\nI had the pleasure of hiking to Gregory Bald on Saturday to see the flame azaleas.
