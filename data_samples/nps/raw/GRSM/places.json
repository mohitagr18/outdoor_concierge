    "bodyText": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>The Cable Mill Area contains many of the buildings typical of remote Appalachian farmsteads. The gristmill is on its original site. Other historic buildings in the complex were brought from elsewhere in the park. The blacksmith shop, though typical of old-time blacksmith shops in the Cove, was built in the 1950s.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>The Cable Mill has become a symbol for the Cades Cove area of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. John P. Cable built his water-powered gristmill and sawmill around 1870. It was one of several in Cades Cove that served about 670 residents. Mills played an important role in people\u2019s lives, and families often looked forward to \u201cmill days\".\u00a0<br /> <br /> A dam on Mill Creek directs water through a canal to the wooden flume that channels water onto the top of the mill wheel. This activates the mechanism for grinding corn with a mill stone. The same wheel powered a heavy reciprocating blade that cut logs. Such technologies made life easier for Cove residents. Many families had small \u201ctub\u201d mills that could grind enough for a family. However, mills like the one belonging to the Cables were larger and faster, if one was willing to give the miller a share of the grain. Mills also removed many back-breaking steps required for traditional log cabin-building.<br /> <br /> Adjacent to the mill is the Gregg-Cable house built in 1879. This is the first and only remaining all-frame house in Cades Cove. All-frame houses were once popular in the cove but were removed after the park was created due to their more modern appearance. The Gregg-Cable house is believed to have been constructed using some of the earliest timber cut on the Cable Mill. A store was operated on the first floor by the Gregg family and later residents, Becky Cable and her brother, Dan Cable. Many of the products necessary for daily life could be purchased there without going to the larger markets of Maryville or Knoxville. Becky and Dan only ran the store for a few years before they sold the contents and turned it into a boarding house. Dan and his wife, Martha, were both ill, and they along with their four children lived with and were supported by Becky. After Dan and Martha died, Becky raised their children, which is why she was known to many as \u201cAunt Becky\".</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Drive the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road and park at the Cades Cove Visitor Center about halfway through the loop.</li> <li>From the\u00a0visitor center parking lot, a paved path creates a loop\u2014the left path leads to the blacksmith shop and the right path leads to the mill.</li> <li>A smokehouse, corn crib, barns, and sorghum mill stand in the Cable Mill area. <strong>Visitors can take advantage of programming here throughout the year. </strong>The mill is operated in warmer months.

    "bodyText": "<p>Human history in Cades Cove started long before the 1800s. Humans have been using the land in this area for thousands of years. The earliest artifact collected in the park is a lithic dated to 7000 BCE. Though they may not have built structures in Cades Cove that are present today, the impact of the Cherokee is felt throughout the cove. Many trails created by the Cherokee are still traveled by visitors hiking or driving today. One of these trails is now Rich Mountain Road which connected the cove to the Tuckaleechee area. Many settlers followed in the Cherokees\u2019 footsteps and used this route and others to reach Cades Cove. The Cherokee, like settlers after them, cut logs for structures and fires. They cleared land for agriculture, and they hunted, foraged, and traded or bought what they didn\u2019t grow themselves. In the early 1810-1820s, Sequoyah developed the Cherokee syllabary, a written version of the Cherokee language.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee name for Cades Cove is Tsiyahi, \u201cOtter Place.\u201d Otters were found throughout the many creeks and streams in the cove, but they were extirpated from this area in the 1920s, after being hunted and trapped for their valuable pelts. The park reintroduced them in the 1980s and they have made a remarkable comeback. Today they are often seen near Abrams Falls. The name \u201cAbrams\u201d stems from Cherokee Chief Abram or Abraham, known as Ooskuah to the Cherokee. The origin of the name \u201cCade\u201d also likely came from Cherokee Chief Cade (or Kade) from this area. A \u201ccove\u201d is a flat valley between mountains or ridges.<br /> <br /> Most of the Cherokee living in the Southeastern United States were forcibly removed starting with the Indian Removal Act in 1830 which offered territory in Oklahoma in exchange for land in this region. In 1835 the Treaty of New Echota ceded most of the Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi to the federal government. These actions resulted in the \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d in 1938, where 16,000 Cherokee\u00a0were forced to walk 1,200 miles west. Thousands died in the process. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee who live on the Qualla Boundary adjacent to the park today are the descendants of the few who remained, escaped, or those who returned. A visit to Cherokee, North Carolina offers visitors an opportunity to learn more about Cherokee history and culture.<br /> <br /> Typically, when a national park or protected area is created, many spaces that people lived in and used are returned to nature. In Cades Cove, this idea is blended with historic preservation. Cades Cove has far fewer buildings than it did at peak settlement around 1900 with over 700 residents. Instead of agricultural fields, today there are grasses and native plants. The cove is actively managed using mowing and prescribed fire to keep trees and woody shrubs at bay. If the cove wasn\u2019t managed this way, it would revert to forest in most areas and look very similar to the woods found throughout the park.</p>",

This cabin, like the John Oliver cabin, is cozy and unassuming\u2014one room with a fireplace, a staircase leading to the loft above, and a porch outside.

Carter fought with the Union Army during the Civil War and was severely wounded at the Battle of Shiloh.

The Shields would remain in this home for 11 years before selling it.<br /> <br /> Soon after this time, the property was acquired as part of the newly created Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

These included\u00a0industrialists, politicians, lawyers, artists, professors, and businessmen, among others. W.B. Townsend, owner of the Little River Lumber Company, became a member and leased logging land to the club to create a hunting and fishing camp. Soon after, Knoxville families began building vacation homes along Jakes Creek. Between 1910 and 1935, almost 80 cabins were built. Before 1925, families arrived by trains (a 3-hour trip) operated by the lumber company. When the logging operations in the area ended in 1925, the railroad tracks were removed, and families began driving their cars to their vacation cabins. The tourist season typically stretched from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Cabin owners brought trunks of clothes and supplies to stay the entire summer. Many would also bring their servants to care for the children.\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{57177f9e-9629-44e9-860b-ba364cdd9db5}{64}\" paraid=\"1766794687\">\u201cSome brought a servant with them, usually Black women who developed their own social life in the mountains.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>Looking around Cades Cove today, it seems like a world far removed from the technologies of modern life, but a closer look reveals evidence of modernization. The Dan Lawson house was originally constructed in 1856 using logs, but later additions were framed. Even later, the entire building was covered with siding. Viewing the house from the side offers a clear visual of these additions. The brick chimney, unusual for the time and locale, was built of bricks made on site. The small building closest to the house is a smokehouse; the other is a granary.<br /> <br /> Dan Lawson was postmaster of the Cove for over 25 years, and for many years the post office was in the center room of this building. The small room on the front porch with an interior window might have been where people picked up their mail. Another idea is that this room functioned as an office during Dan Lawson\u2019s time as Justice of the Peace. This room likely started as a \u201cstranger room\u201d (see Elijah Oliver Place) and then was converted to a new use.<br /> <br /> Dan Lawson also operated a store and owned one of the largest tracts of land in Cades Cove. During the 1890s, Dan Lawson and other residents constructed a telephone line into Cades Cove. As a result, several homes in the Cove had telephones. Even residents without a telephone on their property could access the one at the Lawson store.<br /> <br /> The typical story of Cades Cove is of pioneer life, but the last residents, the Caughrons, left in 1999. They had an agricultural lease and helped the park maintain the open fields of the cove. Their home was to the left of the Dan Lawson place. None of the structures they used remain, except the barn which they had moved from the Cable Mill area when it was threatened with demolition. Today, to the left of this barn, you can still see an old apple tree and a handful of lilies that were once part of their garden\u2014a reminder that though Cades Cove has changed much over the years, some things remain the same.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Dan Lawson Place is about 7 miles into the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road\u00a0just past the intersection with Hyatt Lane.</li> </ul> <h2>Similar Points of Interest</h2> <ul> <li>Other historic structures in Cades Cove</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Overview</h3> <p>Elijah Oliver was born in 1824 to John and Lucretia Oliver. Although he spent most of his life living in the cove, he did leave during the Civil War, relocating to Tuckaleechee Cove to escape attacks from Confederate supporters and rebel groups out of North Carolina. Attacks were devastating for the Cades Cove community. In 1850, Cades Cove had over 600 settlers, but the population plummeted to under 300 in the war era. Many settlers returned, but it took time for Cades Cove to recover to pre-war population levels.<br /> <br /> Elijah and his family did return to Cades Cove after the war and bought property in 1865 for a farmstead. The cabin that Elijah Oliver\u2019s family lived in was a dog trot style cabin which consists of two cabins that were connected by a breezeway and shared a common roof. Along with the dog trot style cabin, Elijah Oliver\u2019s homestead would eventually include a corn crib, smokehouse, springhouse, and barn. The springhouse was built over a trickling spring to ensure clean water for the family. The spring\u2019s cool temperature was also harnessed to extend the life of perishables such as eggs, milk, and butter. The springhouse is a unique feature since it is the only one remaining in the cove.<br /> <br /> Another unique feature of the Elijah Oliver place is the stranger room.

    "bodyText": "<h3>Overview</h3> <p>The John Oliver cabin is the first historic structure on the 11-mile Cades Cove driving loop. It is also the oldest. John, Lucretia, and their young daughter, Mary \u201cPolly,\u201d arrived and began settling in Cades Cove in 1818.<br /> <br /> Although the Olivers were the first permanent European-American settlers, Cherokee peoples had lived in this area for thousands of years. The Cherokee were present at the time of the Olivers\u2019 arrival and had an active settlement. According to Lucretia Oliver, the family survived their first winter only because of the generosity of the Cherokee who provided them with food.<br /> <br /> John Oliver was a War of 1812 veteran and collier (charcoal maker) by trade. He lived in neighboring east Tennessee counties before the prospect of settlement in Cades Cove came to be. The cove was different in 1818 from how it looks today. When the Olivers arrived, it had not yet been extensively cleared for agriculture and was densely forested except for the west end of the cove which was swampland. The Olivers decided to settle on the drier east end of the cove.<br /> <br /> A well was dug for a reliable water source as the neighboring creek often dries in the summer. Fields were cleared for planting wheat and corn. Cattle were kept along nearby Abrams Creek. A barn with grain storage was constructed. A second cabin, the one that still stands today, was built in the 1820s just a few dozen yards from the original cabin (not standing today). A kitchen was added to the present cabin but has since been removed by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Generations of Olivers lived on the homestead until the park was established over a hundred years later.

With only a budget of $20,000, and working in harsh winter conditions, Olmsted Brothers tasked partner Henry Hubbard with the design.<br /> <br /> Hubbard was tasked with transforming the \u201cnose of a little hill\u201d into a spiral of two terraces climbing up the hill\u2019s slope. When it came to construction for the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, the Civilian Conservation Corps were commissioned, working until 1940.<br /> <br /> When development began, Hubbard created a clay model of two semicircular stone block terraces hugging the face of the hill, connected by steps leading to a lookout. Models were created at the request of a client and were almost immediately taken apart after completion of the design. After Hubbard created his model for the Spelman Memorial, he took a light and tracked the path of sunlight, to ensure that light shined on the memorial. This extra attention to detail is what helped make the Olmsted firm so prolific.<br /> <br /> <em>Source</em>: \"Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial,\" <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/laura-spelman-rockefeller-memorial\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <br /> For more information and primary resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4261,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157666410174904/\">Olmsted Archives on Flickr </a>",

Jack Huff, the lodge\u2019s founder and a Gatlinburg mountaineer, began constructing the rustic retreat in 1926. Jack, along with wife Pauline and their family, operated the lodge until 1960. Huff built many of the existing buildings still used today. From 1960 to 1975, Herrick and Myrtle Brown owned and operated the lodge. Jim Huff, Hugh Ogle, and Bill Rinearson shared ownership of the lodge from 1976 to 1989. The Stokely family began its tenure of lodge ownership and operational oversight in 1989.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>The Cades Cove Methodist Church was constructed in 1902. The congregation can be dated back to 1830, with the first Methodist circuit riders visiting the cove in the early 1820s. Originally, services were held in homes until a log meeting house was built in 1840. The Methodists had a good relationship with the Primitive and Missionary Baptists, the latter of which used the log building for meetings and worship.</p> <p>As the larger Methodist Episcopal Church started to split in 1844 over the issue of slavery, the Methodists of Cades Cove were not immune, and began to break apart. One group split off, and in 1880 built the Hopewell Methodist Church near the south end of Hyatt Lane;\u00a0but this building is no longer standing. After the Civil War, the original log meeting house soon became a schoolhouse, but was still used for worship.</p> <p>In 1902, the cove\u2019s Methodists replaced the old log meeting house with the current frame building. Blacksmith and carpenter Rev. J.D. McCampbell was said to have built the structure for $115 in 115 days. McCampbell later served as the church\u2019s minister for many years. The new building follows the design of having two entrances for the practice of dividing men and women up during services, but the Methodists in Cades Cove never followed that custom.</p> <p>Today, many of the cove\u2019s early settlers like the Tiptons, Feezells, and Sparkses are buried at the Methodist Church\u2019s cemetery. This cemetery is most likely the second oldest church burial plot in the cove and continues to be used by descendants. Like the other churches in Cades Cove, the Methodist Church is still occasionally used for worship.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Drive the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road.

The congregation remained small and initially met in homes and sometimes in the Methodist Church for Sunday school and worship. Like other churches in the cove, the Civil War disrupted meetings from October 1862 to 1865. There was an additional period from 1880 to 1889 in which no meetings were held with no record of reasoning. In 1889, a Sunday school was started, and the small congregation began meeting again.<br /> <br /> In 1893, evangelist Rev. Thomas Sexton led a successful revival for the Missionary Baptist Church that resulted in the congregation almost doubling in size, going from 22 members to 40 members. After this, J.M. Saults was called as the new pastor and the first physical building for the congregation was built in 1894. The first building was on Hyatt Hill near the present-day site, replaced in 1915 by the current building. A Sunday school was started in 1898 and continued to meet until 1944, 10 years after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established.</p>",

Before it became the largest campground in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Elkmont was the second largest town in Sevier County. By 1918, the town had over 1,500 residents and was considered a \u201ccompany town\u201d built by the Little River Lumber Company and Railroad in 1908. The company owned almost 80,000 acres of what is now the national park. Elkmont\u2019s strategic location (halfway between Clingmans Dome and the town of Townsend) made it economical to transport cut trees by railroad to the sawmill in Townsend, then off to markets around the world. \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{54}\" paraid=\"815106061\">Standing at the present-day yield sign on your left, look down the road to your right where the walk-in tent sites are located. Using the photograph circa 1917/18, try to imagine Elkmont\u2019s former Main Street or Rail Street where a single railroad track ran 18 miles from Townsend. The track was divided into three tracks for the short length of the town of Elkmont. (You are standing at the bottom right corner of the photo. The flat straight drive was built directly on the old railroad bed.) The town consisted of a commissary (company store), church, school, hotel, tavern, machine shop, and employee houses. Not long after the town opened, Little River Lumber Company leased the land east of Elkmont town to the Appalachian Club of Knoxville, and west of town to the Wonderland Club.\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{122}\" paraid=\"646166563\">By 1925, the lumber company finished logging the area, pulled up all the rails, closed the town, and started logging the area known as Tremont.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{132}\" paraid=\"131947901\">It is hard to believe that just over 100 years ago this area was a bustling town of over 1,500 residents. \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{146}\" paraid=\"1744571511\">As you travel between stops, look for signs of the people who came before us, watch for distinct gaps in the forest which could indicate the route of an old railroad bed, or consider the size and type of trees around you. Learning to read the landscape can reveal clues about a time gone by\u2026\u00a0</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>Primitive Baptist Church was first organized in 1827 and was the first church established in the cove. Originally, the church was a branch of Wears Cove Church of Sevier County and was known as the Cades Cove Arm of Wears Cove Church. Eventually, the church separated from Wears Cove Church and changed its name to Cades Cove Baptist Church. Initially, the church had no permanent structure for meetings since it was the first church established in the cove. Church meetings were held in the homes of members until the fall of 1832, when a log building was constructed for meetings and services.<br /> <br /> Shortly after, disagreement among members caused a split in the church. In 1839, 13 members left to start Missionary Baptist Church due to disagreement over foreign mission work. To reflect the difference in opinion, Cades Cove Baptist Church assumed the name Primitive Baptist Church in 1841 and has gone by that name since. The churches in Cades Cove were not isolated in this conflict.\u00a0Baptist churches all over the South were divided on the issue of mission work in the early nineteenth century. In 1887, after the split, members of Primitive Baptist Church constructed the classic white frame building you see today to replace the original log meeting house. The church was built by hand, and the fingerprints of those that worked on its construction can be seen on the ceiling when inside the church.<br /> <br /> Running and maintaining the church required labor and perseverance, but this was a worthwhile endeavor for the residents of the cove who were able to celebrate and affirm their faith. The church created community, upheld social responsibilities, and kept families informed. Of the churches in the cove, the Primitive Baptist Church maintained the most members and social influence. The church was a vital part of life for many residents, but during the Civil War, life in the cove changed dramatically. The congregation ceased meeting, which was upsetting for residents and explained in church records by the statement, \u201cwe was union people and the Rebels was too strong here in Cades Cove.\u201d In the cemetery behind Primitive Baptist Church, you can find the grave of Russell Gregory, who was murdered by Confederate soldiers from North Carolina.<br /> <br /> Although Great Smoky Mountains National Park was officially established in 1934, members of Primitive Baptist did not stop meeting at the church until the 1960s. After formally closing the church in the 1960s, the congregation continued to maintain the building and the cemetery into the 1970s through a Special Use Permit. The church is often still used for religious events or ceremonies. The cemetery at Primitive Baptist is the oldest cemetery in the cove, and descendants of early settlers such as the Olivers, Shieldses, and Cables, are still being laid to rest in it today.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Drive the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road.

    "bodyText": "<p>The story of #BarkRanger Smoky Jack and his human Paul Adams began in 1925. Paul accepted a caretaker position on Mount Le Conte, a high peak in the Great Smoky Mountains. The rustic camp that Paul and Smoky Jack established is a popular lodge in the National Park,\u00a0100 years later!</p> <p>Paul was born in Illinois in 1901 and his family moved to Tennessee when he was a teenager. Paul\u2019s first ascent of Mount Le Conte was accomplished at age 17 and five years later he joined the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club. Smoky Jack, a German Shepherd, was destined for work with the police force. He completed training in New Jersey and was enroute to Tennessee when the K9 officer he would have partnered with was killed in the line of duty.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s mother was concerned that he was alone on the mountain. Paul purchased Smoky Jack with a down payment and installments, and a lifelong partnership began. The two had many adventures in all seasons as they worked and hiked in the Smokies. Smoky Jack carried saddlebags filled with supplies from the store in Gatlinburg and protected Paul during a couple threats from robbers. The dog saved his human more than once during medical emergencies in winter and during an unexpected encounter with a bear!</p> <p>Their time on Mount Le Conte came to an end once the lodge was established and a married couple were hired to host guests visiting the 6,593-foot peak that is the third highest in the Smoky Mountain Range. Smoky Jack stayed on the mountain for a bit with the new caretakers, but regularly ran off to Paul who had moved to Gatlinburg. The dog moved in with Paul\u2019s parents and later with Paul and his wife Maxine. Smoky Jack lived to be fourteen years old and was buried on the Adams farm in Cumberland County, Tennessee.</p>",

William\u2019s land eventually covered most of the valley floor through other grants, and while he never lived in Cades Cove, he is the first recorded legal landowner. William sold his land to friends and relatives including Colonel Hamp Tipton, his grandson, who built the two-story cabin in the 1870s.\u00a0Hamp Tipton\u2019s daughters, Lucy and Lizzie, lived in the cove into adulthood and were schoolteachers. In 1878, the home was rented to James McCaulley as he built his own homestead that included blacksmith and carpentry shops. In 1895, Hamp Tipton passed away and his estate was sold to Reverend William H. Oliver, whose family lived there until the land was purchased for the park in 1931. The site is sometimes referred to as the Tipton-Oliver homestead in reference to both families that lived there.<br /> <br /> The homestead of Hamp Tipton included the two-story cabin he built, barn, double-pen corn crib, blacksmith shop, smokehouse, woodshed, springhouse, apple drying house, and bee apiary. Apiaries were sometimes referred to as bee gums, as early beehives were kept in hollowed out Blackgum trees (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>). The homestead now sits on 2.2 acres. The framed buildings including the springhouse and apple drying house, as well as framed additions to the cabin and a post-1900 barn, were all removed to maintain a sense of historical continuity and preserve a specific era of life in the cove.<br /> <br /> The lefthand door on the front of the house leads into the living room with three paned windows and a fireplace. To the left of the fireplace are stairs to the sleeping loft on the second floor. The righthand door leads into the main bedroom, which has two, small paned windows. The back room of the house was once the kitchen. This room has two windows and two doors; one door leads to a small porch and the other leads to the back of the property. The kitchen has two holes close together on one of the walls where a telephone was attached. This connected to the blacksmith shop on the homestead as well as a store which was located across the road.<br /> <br /> One of the most unique parts of the Tipton Place is the cantilever barn which was reconstructed in 1968. Cantilever barns have overhangs, or cantilevers, used to store hay for easy access, with spaces for livestock pens, grain cribs, and equipment storage underneath. This allowed farmers to maximize the amount of storage possible for their livelihoods, while keeping livestock and equipment dry from the rainy eastern Tennessee weather. Cantilever barns can be found across the southeastern United States, but Sevier and Blount counties in Tennessee have the highest number of cantilever barns in the world.</p> <h2>How to Get There</h2> <ul> <li>Drive the 11-mile, one-way Cades Cove Loop Road.

    "bodyText": "<p>A short drive down Forge Creek Road leads to the Henry Whitehead Place, a uniquely built home and the last example of a sawn log house in the park. The story of this home begins with the smaller cabin in the back. This cabin is simple, but visitors today might notice the \u2018granny hole\u2019 by the fireplace. It provided the person tending the fire with a window outside. This one room cabin was built roughly and quickly out of necessity for Matilda Shields by her brothers in 1881. Matilda and her young son were abandoned by her husband during a visit to see family in Cades Cove. Around the same time, Henry Whitehead lost his wife and became a single father to three young daughters. He and Matilda married in 1887, and he built the larger home in the front between 1895-1898.<br /> <br /> This home is often mistaken for a frame structure because it is built of logs that were run through a sawmill and \u201csquared up,\u201d resulting in a smooth, consistent appearance. You can compare this construction to the more common hewn log structure of the original cabin where logs were roughly flattened by hand. Since the logs were irregular shapes, the spaces between the logs had to be filled, or chinked, with mud or clay. With a sawn log building like the Henry Whitehead cabin, the logs fit together so well that almost no chinking was required resulting in a well-insulated home. These two cabins are connected by a covered passageway and serve as an architectural link between the different construction types in Cades Cove.<br /> <br /> The outbuilding next to the cabin is a smokehouse, one of five remaining in Cades Cove today. The floor of the smokehouse was often kept as dirt, on which the fire could be built. Freshly cut oak or hickory wood was often used, but water could also be added to older wood to increase smoke production. Smokehouses have interior shelves on which the smoked hams and other meats could be stored for later use. In Cades Cove, the meat was almost always pork because hogs were inexpensive to feed and easy to raise. Smokehouses were typically constructed close to the house for convenience and to provide protection from bears which were attracted by the smell of smoked meats. The structures needed to be sturdy and well-sealed to keep out wildlife, but also to keep in the smoke used for preservation. Storing food safely from wildlife has always been an important challenge and is one people still face today.<br /> <br /> The Henry Whitehead place stands alone today, but during its occupation, homes lined Forge Creek Road. There were other large sawed-log houses built by Frederick Shields and James V. Cable, but unfortunately, these buildings were not preserved. This road also leads to another road, Parson Branch Road, which you can drive during the warmer months. This one-way, unpaved, high clearance road leads to Highway 129 and travels through the former area of the Chestnut Flats community.

This area preserves 18 structures, two cemeteries, and over 100 years of stories, memories, and dreams that represent the last evidence of the tourism history of the Smokies. This area was first settled in the mid-1800s by descendants of Gatlinburg families. By the early 1900s, most of the land was bought by the second largest lumber company in the area and eventually became the first piece of property purchased to create Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Most of the cabin owners in Elkmont Historic District not only supported the national park movement, but also donated money to help buy land to create the park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{3c31ed00-873f-41a6-a02e-d594f21019fb}{165}\" paraid=\"1285606826\">The important stories of this area were almost lost, but considerable time, research, and back-breaking work preserved this piece of park history. Please help us preserve and protect this and other historic areas of the park by respecting the memories of the people who lived here and the work of the park\u2019s preservation staff.
