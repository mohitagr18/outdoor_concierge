    "longDescription": "<p>The Snow Pass Ski Trail is a 4.2-mile (6.76-km), skier-tracked easiest to most difficult one-way ski that takes skiers through a heavily forested area to wide open views of Swan Lake Flats. To get to the Snow Pass Ski Trail\u00a0take the short connector trail that joins from the upper end of the Upper Terrace Loop Ski Trail. The heavily forested trail ascends 700 feet in 1.5 miles (213 m in 2.4 km) through a series of very steep grades along the trail to Snow Pass. From Snow Pass, the trail continues 0.5 miles (0.8 km) down over rolling terrain to a trail junction where the ski route turns left (south) and follows Glen Creek over fairly level terrain for 2.2 miles (3.5 km), meeting the road just south of Rustic Falls (in the winter, the road is only open to limted travel in oversnow vehicles). From here, you can either continue across the road to the Bunsen Peak Road Ski Trail (see decription) or return the way you came.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b> CAUTION: some curves have steep drop-offs and can be hazardous when icy. Bison and elk frequent this trail. Federal regulations require you to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison and all other wild animals.</p> <p>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-snow-pass-ski-trail.htm#Details\">ski trail details and accessibility information</a> at the bottom of this page.</p>",

This caldera filled with lava flows over hundreds and thousands of years creating the volcanic plateau that comprises much of the central part of the park.</p> <p>Here at Mud Volcano you are close to one of the resurgent domes. The hills you see east of here comprise Sour Creek Dome. Resurgent domes are areas of active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, many of the park\u2019s geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles are also found near or within the caldera.</p>",

It is uncommon to be able to predict geyser eruptions with regularity and Old Faithful has lived up to its name, only lengthening the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30 years. The reliability of Old Faithful inspired early developers to build special viewing areas, lodging, and concessions for visitors to watch eruptions.</p> <p>Thermal features change constantly and it is possible Old Faithful may stop erupting someday. Geysers and other thermal features are evidence of ongoing volcanic activity beneath the surface and change is part of this natural system. Yellowstone preserves the natural geologic processes so that visitors may continue to enjoy this natural system.</p>",

The Fawn Pass trailhead is located 22 miles (35.4 km) north of West Yellowstone along US Highway 191. Avalanche danger is moderate in the last 6 miles (9.7 km) to Fawn Pass. After crossing several fingers of the Gallatin River, the trail gradually ascends 700 feet (213.4 m) in 5 miles (8 km) to the Bighorn Pass Cutoff. The cutoff trail switchbacks downhill approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) to Bighorn Pass Trail. After the junction with the cutoff trail, the Fawn Pass ski trail then climbs for 6 miles (9.7 km) to Fawn Pass. Return the same way.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b> Bison and elk frequent this trail.

    "longDescription": "<p>The Natural Bridge bike trail is 2.5 mi (4km) round-trip ride and begins just south of the Bridge Bay marina off the Grand Loop Road. Most of the trail follows an old paved road (mostly disintegrated but fairly level with an elevation gain of 317 feet). The trail meanders through the forest then joins a service road and continues west. There is no biking beyond the service road portion of the trail. ONLY HIKING is allowed from this point to the Natural Bridge. The short but steep switchback loop trail to the top of the bridge starts in front of the interpretive exhibit. The natural bridge is a 51 foot (18 m) cliff of rhyolite rock cut through by Bridge Creek. To protect this fragile resource, the top of the bridge is closed to off-trail hiking. Exercise caution along the creek bed for wet and slippery rocks. Mountain bikes are recommended.</p> <p><strong>Alerts:</strong> Be alert for bears: both black and grizzly bears forage in this area. The trail is generally closed until early summer while bears feed on spawning trout in Bridge Creek. Federal regulations require you to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison and all other wild animals. Wear bear spray while riding. Inquire at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/lakevc.htm\">Fishing Bridge Visitor Center</a> for opening dates and other closures.</p>",

These minerals contribute to the beautiful terrace structures, along with heat, a natural \u201cplumbing\u201d system, water, and limestone.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources, including the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera, or perhaps a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>At Mammoth, a network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface. The water comes from rain and snow falling on the surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open.</p> <p>Limestone, deposited here millions of years ago when a vast sea covered this area, provides the final ingredient. Hot water with dissolved carbon dioxide makes a solution of weak carbonic acid. As the solution rises through rock, it dissolves calcium carbonate, the primary compound in limestone. At the surface, the calcium carbonate is deposited in the form of travertine, the rock that forms the terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b> Thermal activity throughout this entire area.

This strenuous, high elevation trail is not recommended for people with heart and/or respiratory problems. Be aware of lightning above treeline. Even on warm summer days, bring rain gear, wool hats, and gloves. Burned trees may fall without warning. Grizzly bears frequent this area in the fall, seeking out whitebark pine nuts. Hiking this trail is not recommended in September and October.</p> <p><b>Trailheads:</b> Look for a pullout at Eleanor Lake, 19 miles (30.6 km) east of Fishing Bridge Junction (8 miles / 12.9 km west of East Entrance). The trailhead is across the road from the pullout.</p>",
