    "longDescription": "<p>175 different species of birds have been documented to frequent Bryce Canyon National Park. Some are just passing through. Others stay for an entire season. Fewer still make this their year-round home, but those that do are charming and charismatic.<br /> Check recent <a href=\"https://ebird.org/hotspot/L268297\">eBird sightings within the park</a>.

But\u00a0by late February and early March western bluebirds and American robins are usually returning to the park from lower elevations. Warblers come a little later, often in late April or May, when yellow-rumped warblers, Grace's warblers, black-throated gray warblers and others begin to be heard. May through July is the busy breeding season within the park, and depending on the year various hummingbirds, such as black-chinned, broad-tailed, and rufuous can be seen visiting thistles and other flowers. The melodious songs of hermit thrushes, the ribbits of western tanagers, or the shreiks of green-tailed towhees or wood-pewees and flycatchers can be heard in ponderosa forests, but often fade by mid-August. The violet-green swallows and cliff swallows seen swooping over the Bryce Amphitheater have disappeared by October in most years. Eruptions of crossbills and Cassin's finches occur every few years in late summer and last through the winter. Come the colder months, year-round residents such as Townsend's solitaires, nuthatches, chickadees, juncos, woodpeckers, corvids, and raptors are most commonly seen.</p> <h3>Where to Look</h3> <p>Some species are common in all areas of the park. These include common ravens, Steller's jays, white-breasted nuthatches, Townsend's solitaires, downy and hairy woodpeckers, and dark-eyed juncos.<br /> <br /> <strong>Southern Scenic Drive: </strong>Travelling to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points at the southern end of the park takes you up to elevations of over 9,000 feet (2,743 m). At these high elevations, the park's ponderosa forests transition to mixed conifer woodlands of white fir, limber pine, douglas-fir, quaking aspen, and bristlecone pine. Snow levels are much higher here in winter, linger longer into spring, and provide more moisture for a dense understory. Species seen more often in this area and along the Bristlecone Loop Trail include dusky grouse, peregrine falcon, Clark's nutcracker, green-tailed towhee, red-breasted nuthatches, pine siskins, and Cassin's finches.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Bryce Amphitheater: </strong>The Bryce Amphitheater is defined by its ponderosa forests. These provide a year-round home for pygmy nuthatches, which travel from tree to tree like squeaking fleas. Those with a sharp ear for higher frequencies and cryptic feathers may spot brown creepers here. In winter mixed flocks of chickadees, nuthatches, juncos, and creepers are not uncommon. In summer, violet-green swallows, white-throated swifts, and cliff swallows can be see swooping along the plateau rim. Owls, such as northern pygmy owls, reward those willing to wander the rim trail or quieter viewpoints like Paria View listening for the chiding chorus of songbirds. Below the rim, wrens, juncos, jays, and small flocks of bushtits can be found.<br /> <br /> <strong>Mossy Cave: </strong>Mossy Cave provides one of the park's only consistent areas of water. Not a wetland, but essentially an irrigation stream travelling through the park, this area nevertheless protects a sometimes bird-rich area near Mossy Cave itself. Turn left at the waterfall junction and keep an eye out in the Gambel oak and Nootka rose for flycatchers and warblers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Tropic Trail: </strong>A best-kept secret in the park, the Tropic Trail provides a quiet, densely vegetated area in the lowest elevations of the Bryce Amphitheater to encounter towhees, jays, nuthatches, juncos, and sometimes unexpected lower-elevation birds (our 2020 Christmas Bird Count encountered a beautiful acorn woodpecker here).<br /> <br /> <strong>Outside the park:</strong> Check out the Rodeo, open fields, and waterpond areas in Bryce Canyon City just north of the park for an abundance of other species including larks, raptors, and sometimes sage grouse.</p>",

The search for food and water leads them to the best place to find sustenance and shelter. Many animals share habitats. Ebb and flow of populations is interdependent on all the members of the wildlife community.</p> <h4>See a full species list at the bottom of this page.</h4> <h4>Safety and Respect</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Treat wildlife with respect - you are a visitor in their home.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Never feed wild animals</strong> - even a chipmunk can inflict a painful bite and possibly spread disease. Feeding them human food is also akin to animal cruelty in its likelihood to lead to maladaptive behaviors or even death.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep a safe distance - use binoculars or, for photography, telephoto lenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>When venturing into venomous snake territory wear boots and loose-fitting pants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stay on trails, and watch where you place your hands and feet \u2013 especially when sitting, climbing, or stepping on or over fences, large rocks, and logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hang food, garbage and anything with strong odors (toothpaste, bug repellent, soap, etc.) at least 10 feet off the ground and 6 feet from the trunk or use a bear-proof container. Never store food inside your tent.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a bear or Mountain Lion approaches you back away slowly. Avoid direct eye contact with a bear but maintain eye contact with a cat. In either case do not run. Raise your arms above your head to make yourself look larger than normal, make noise, and throw rocks or sticks.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Seasons</h3> <p>Spring comes late at these high elevations, with snow often remaining into April. Many of the park's inhabitants either hibernate or move to lower, less snow-covered elevations. While large mammals\u00a0like Mule Deer can be seen year-round, pronghorn typically depart in fall and aren't seen again until snow has begun to melt in spring. Utah Prairie Dogs typically begin to depart underground for hibernation by November, and the first males are often seen reemerging in late February or early March. Other species are extremely uncommon--mountain lions are present but seldom seen, as are the park's black bears, which overwinter in dens and spend summers foraging in less-travelled forests. In warmer months, you're almost guaranteed to be confronted by a Unita chipmunk or golden-mantled ground squirrel scavenging near viewpoints or trail junctions. Remember to never feed or approach any wildlife in the park.\u00a0</p> <h3>Where to Look</h3> <p><br /> <strong>Utah Prairie Dog Colonies:\u00a0</strong>A threatened species, in the 1970s the Utah Prairie Dog was\u00a0expected to go extinct by the year 2000. Thankfully reintroduction efforts here in the park in the 1980s have stabliized the largest population of Utah's only endemic (only found here) mammal. The smallest of the prairie dogs, 8,000 feet (2,438 m) is about as high as they'll live. From March through October you can pretty realiably find them near the entrances to their underground burrows in the meadow that crosses the main road immediately south of the Visitor Center. Another colony is found on the right-hand side of the road around Mile 2 of the park road. A third colony can be seen on the way to Sunrise Point after taking the second left turn past the Visitor Center. Be sure to observe them from road pull-offs but never enter these meadows. Not only do prairie dogs potentially carry fleas infected with plague, they can deliver a very powerful bite!<br /> Prairie dogs provide food for most predators in the park, so observing a prairie dog colony is often the best way to see other species too. Listen for when the prairie dogs begin to chitter and \"bark\"--this may alert you to a predator along the treeline or soaring above.<br /> <br /> <strong>Southern Scenic Drive:\u00a0</strong>Travelling to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points at the southern end of the park takes you up to elevations of over 9,000 feet (2,743 m). At these high elevations, the park's ponderosa forests transition to mixed conifer woodlands of white fir, limber pine, douglas-fir, quaking aspen, and bristlecone pine. Snow levels are much higher here in winter, linger longer into spring, and provide more moisture for a dense understory. Wildlife is most often seen in meadows leading up to these higher views, such as the meadow around Mile 4 of the 18 mile park road. More often than not, wildlife sightings here are large mammals seen crossing the road.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Bryce Amphitheater:\u00a0</strong>The Bryce Amphitheater is defined by its ponderosa forests and the mixed juniper and ponderosa woodland below the rim. Here one sees chipmunks and ground squirrels in warmer months, and often small families of mule deer foraging above and below the rim. If you're out stargazing, you may be so lucky as to spot a ringtail--they've most often been seen near the Sunset Point parking lot.</p>",

One of the best times of year is June, which coincides with our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/astrofest.htm\">Annual Astronomy Festival</a>. Here are a couple\u00a0tips:</p> <h4>Full Moons</h4> <p>If you're hoping to see the park under the bright light of a full moon, then be sure to plan a visit that will coincide with our\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fullmoonhikes.htm\">full moon hike</a>\u00a0ranger programs. But if you're hoping to see lots of stars, you're better off coming closer to a <strong>new moon\u00a0</strong>when the moon will have set with the sun and won't compete with the stars for brightness.</p> <h4>Milky Way</h4> <p>While you can see some part of the Milky Way year-round at this latitude, the most iconic and vibrant views are when the galactic center is visible in the sky. June through August will provide the best views in this regard if you're hoping to see the night sky not too long after sunset. If you're willing to be up at 4 a.m., well that changes things. Websites like <a href=\"https://stellarium-web.org/\">Stellarium can help you predict</a> what you might be seeing on the date and various times of your visit. Winter visitors have the rare distinction of seeing the outer bands of the Milky Way, which are relatively much dimmer. In this day and age, few people have ever seen the Milky Way. A fraction of a fraction of those people have been in a place so dark that they can see the winter Milky Way.</p> <h3>Recommended\u00a0Viewpoints</h3> <p><strong>Sunrise Point</strong><br /> Requires a short walk to the viewpoint, but provides a nearly 360 degree view with relatively little light pollution from nearby Tropic and Bryce Canyon City.<br /> <strong>Inspiration Point</strong><br /> Very close to its parking lot (in case it's cold) with the opportunity for 360 degree views at higher viewpoints.<br /> <strong>Whiteman Bench Picnic Area (Mile 9.5 of the 18 mile road)</strong><br /> According to darkness readings, this is one of the darkest places in the whole park.\u00a0<br /> <strong>Yovimpa Point</strong><br /> A grand view looking south with only very distant light pollution from Page, AZ.</p> <h3>Astrophotography</h3> <p>If you're looking for opportunities to get some hoodoos in the foreground of your night sky shots, consider these trails:<br /> <strong>Queen's Garden Trail</strong><br /> Good views with hoodos to the south, east, and west<br /> <strong>Navajo Loop</strong><br /> Good views with tall fins of rock and some hoodoos to the east and north.</p>",
