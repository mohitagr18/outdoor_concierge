Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike: your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike going down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing. Proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake can cause\u00a0<strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

Bicycles and leashed pets are permitted on this hard-packed trail.</p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>One-way Distance:</strong> 1.9 miles (3.1 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong> Minimal<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time: </strong>1 hour</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> If you are confident in your abilities on this steeply-paved trail, communicate your intentions with someone who will notice if you are overdue.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike: your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike going down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy balancing. Proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake can cause\u00a0<strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

Ancient examples of geologic processes that have shaped our planet over eons are visible here and help us understand similar, modern processes still occurring today.<br /> <br /> The fossils contained within these rocks add another layer to the story and often provide the clues needed to understand the environments that shaped the landscape so long ago, but finding these tiny, ellusive fossils can be difficult in the face of the immensity of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> Thankfully the Bright Angel Fault Fossil beds provide an easy solution. Located on the rim of the canyon, a short walk west of the first shuttle stop on the Hermit Road, access to the site is open to the public.\u00a0<br /> <br /> This site tells the tale of a world far different than the one we see here today.

What will your eyes discover at this one-of-a-kind place along the south rim?<br /> <br /> Remember that the fossils we see and enjoy here today are the ones left to us by the visitors of yesterday and it's up to us to leave what we find for tomorrow's visitors and all those that come after. Feel free to explore and handle the rocks and fossils on your own or with a park ranger, but leave them for the next visitor.<br /> <br /> Please do not mark, mar, or otherwise damage the site during your visit.

The length of the trail is exposed to the elements;\u00a0watch out for thunderstorms during the summer months and seek shelter in the Grand Canyon Lodge if you see lightning or hear thunder.\u00a0</p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong>\u00a00.5 miles (0.8 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong>\u00a0Minimal<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong>\u00a030 minutes</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/northrimstatus.htm\">North Rim - Current Status and Closures</a></strong></li> </ul>",

Before you hike, check at the Visitor Center or Backcountry Information Center for water status on the trail - or visit the <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a></strong> webpage - or scen the QR code at the trailhead.<br /> <br /> Even though the Bright Angel Trail has water stations along the trail, carrying your own water is still necessary. Water from natural\u00a0sources such as creeks and springs should be purified. When hiking in a group, each person should be carrying water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Bright Angel Trail is considered the most popular hiking trail in the park. Well-maintained and graded for stock, it is fairly easy to walk down. This can be a blessing or a curse. Wide views of the inner canyon and distant formations often distract hikers from just\u00a0how far down the trail they've walked. The return hike back up and out of the canyon is far more difficult and requires much more\u00a0effort. Plan for at least twice as much time back up as it took to go down.<br /> <br /> While South Kaibab Trail follows a ridge line, Bright Angel Trail is tucked deep within a\u00a0side canyon along a massive fault, which keeps the trail in\u00a0this side canyon for\u00a0the first few miles. The majority of the trail's elevation change takes place\u00a0in the upper four miles via a series of switchbacks that seem endless. Views are framed by massive cliffs, with more plant and animal life thanks to a higher degree of shade and natural water sources. If you're interested in geology or wildlife, this is a trail with complementary features. You can expect to see mules on the trail\u00a0as well. See below for more information.<br /> <br /> The trail levels out as it approaches Havasupai Gardens, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and over 2,000 vertical feet (925 meters) below the rim. This destination is an oasis within\u00a0the canyon, home to\u00a0the Havasupai\u00a0People until they were forced to leave when the National Park was established. From here, you might consider the relatively flat (but very exposed) 3-mile (4.8-km) round trip hike to Plateau Point for sunrise or sunset.<br /> <br /> Hikers interested in planning a trip beyond these destinations should consult a park ranger.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> During late fall, winter, and early spring, temperatures regularly\u00a0drop below freezing, and upper portions of this steep trail can become dangerously icy. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended during these times of year. Consult a park ranger for current trail conditions.<br /> <br /> Before heading down into the canyon, <strong>consult the signs at the trailhead</strong> for trip planning and <strong>current weather, trail information and trail closures</strong>. (or visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a> webpage).<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> Before your hike, it is critical to determine\u00a0your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>\u2014a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and even death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the directions of\u00a0the wranglers.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for all\u00a0camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and how to apply <strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online</a></strong>, or talk with a ranger\u00a0at the Backcountry Information Center, if you are visiting the South Rim.</p> <ul> <li>Only camp in designated campsites - <strong>Havasupai Gardens Campground</strong> offers 15 small group sites and 1 large group site.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0</li> <li><strong>CLOSED:</strong> <strong>Bright Angel Campground</strong>,\u00a0located on the north side of the Colorado River at Phantom Ranch, offers 30 small group sites and 2 large group sites.\u00a0<strong>On November 1, 2025, Phantom Ranch and Bright Angel Campground are tentatively expected to reopen to the public. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/south-rim-corridor-trails-partially-reopened.htm\">Details</a></strong></li> </ul>",

After his death, the cabin was bought by entrepreneur James Thurber, who owned and operated the nearby Bright Angel Hotel. Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building. The hotel, including Buckey's cabin, was sold to Martin Buggeln in 1901, and was later acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad after the completion of the El Tovar Hotel in 1905. The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge. It remains operating as one of\u00a0Bright Angel Lodge's active guest cabins to this day.</p>",

The small, teardrop-shaped parking area is fine for cars and small RVs, but larger vehicles and those towing trailers will find turning around a bit tight.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Prior to using the land for a cattle ranching venture, Martin Buggeln first became involved with Grand Canyon when he moved here in 1901 from Williams, Arizona. After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>",

This adventure has no major technical challenges, but scrambling and careful decision-making are needed to choose safe routes over ledges and dropoffs. Named after church-like Cathedral Rock at the head of this small canyon, your journey will take you deeper and deeper through Kaibab Limestone and Toroweap Formations until ending at the river, where canyon debris created Cathedral Wash Rapid.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> While this hike is quite scenic and popular, please know your limits. The wash layout changes throughout the year due to flash floods, rockfalls, and weather. It is easy to cliff out, overheat, or get stuck in mud. Bring good shoes, water, and and any other hiking essentials you need. Securing ropes for technical climbing is not permitted. DO NOT enter this wash if rain is forecasted. Flash floods can be deadly.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead:</strong> Follow the Lees Ferry access road 1.3 miles (2.1 km). The trailhead is at the pull out on your left. You can access both upper and lower Cathedral Wash from this parking area. No overnight parking.</p>",

Just across the road, the trail heads down along a wash down into a forested ravine.<br /> <br /> After passing an archaeological site, the trail descends further and cuts over to the right side of the wash. From here you wander underneath rocky outcrops until you reach a chest-high boulder resting under one of these large overhangs. The spring is on the cliff side of the boulder. The trail ends at the spring, .4 mile from the trailhead.<br /> <br /> Do NOT drink the water.</p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance</strong>:\u00a01.0 miles (1.6 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change</strong>:\u00a0~ 300 feet (~91 m)<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time</strong>:\u00a01-2 hours</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your hike and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia\u00a0</strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Desert View Point (Elevation: 7438 feet/ 2267 meters)</strong>\u00a0<br /> <br /> Starting from the main Desert View parking area, a short .25 mile (.4 km) walk takes you past restrooms, the general store/market and the trading post.\u00a0The point itself is located a few steps beyond the base of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-watchtower.htm\">historic Watchtower</a>. There are guardrails around the cliff edge for your safety.<br /> <br /> Directly below is the Colorado River's \"Big Bend\", where it dramatically shifts its previously southward course by executing a sharp 90-degree turn to the west, cutting directly into a major uplift on the Colorado Plateau known as the Kaibab Upwarp. Looking to the west, one can glimpse in the distance where the river plunges into the black, narrow, confined depths of the Granite Gorge.The airline distance to the opposite rim of the canyon is 18 miles; to the Colorado River, 4 miles. The river is about 300 feet wide as seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> To the east, several thousand feet below where you are now standing, is the broad expanse of a plateau known as the Marble Platform, which is part of the Navajo Nation. The brilliant colors of the Painted Desert can be glimpsed in the distance.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Also to the\u00a0east,\u00a0and situated back from the Canyon rim,\u00a0is a prominent flat-topped mesa\u00a0called Cedar Mountain. Just beyond this mountain the Little Colorado River gorge extends north and south as a crack in the surface of the earth. Tracing the gorge to the left, one may see where it connects with Grand Canyon. The point of connection is where Grand Canyon begins. From that point the Canyon extends 217 miles westward as measured by the Colorado River. Fifty miles of the canyon may be seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> Dark cliffs bordering the Colorado River below Desert View are composed of lavas resulting from volcanic activity long before the cutting of Grand Canyon began. For the most part the walls of Grand Canyon consist of material which hardened into rock after being deposited by wind or water: Consequently, this lava rock is very different in origin and character from the rest of the rocks of the Canyon walls.</p> <h3>1956 Aviation Accident Memorial</h3> <p>At Desert View point, a National Historic Landmark plaque and stone memorial commemorate the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site,<strong> </strong>a horrific airline collision over\u00a0Grand Canyon that took place on June 30, 1956.\u00a0<br /> <br /> On that day,\u00a0a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon, and\u00a0killing all 128 people onboard the two flights. The tragedy spurred an unprecedented effort to modernize and increase safety in America\u2019s postwar airways, culminating in the establishment of the modern Federal Aviation Administration.\u00a0</p> <h3>National Historic Landmarks Program</h3> <p>The National Historic Landmarks Program, established in 1935, is administered by the National Park Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The agency works with preservation officials, private property owners, and other partners interested in nominating properties for National Historic Landmark designation. Completed nominations are reviewed by the National Park System Advisory Board, which makes recommendations for designation to the Secretary of the Interior. This site was dedicated as one of the nation's newest National Historic Landmarks on Tuesday, July 8, 2014.</p>",

From there, the Watchtower is in plain view.<br /> <br /> Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Watchtower was constructed in 1932. Architect Mary Colter\u2019s design takes its influences from the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloan people of the Colorado Plateau. This particular tower was patterned after those found at Hovenweep and the Round Tower of Mesa Verde. Colter indicated that it was not a copy of any that she had seen, but rather modeled from several.<br /> <br /> The view from the\u00a0Watchtower provides a unique perspective of the eastern portion of Grand Canyon. From here, looking to the northeast offers a distant glimpse of the Colorado River's transition from the relatively narrow Marble Canyon to the north into the much wider, broader expanse of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> For more about\u00a0what can be seen from here, view\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-point-1956-aviation-accident-memorial.htm\">Desert View Point.</a></p> <h3>The View Room</h3> <p>This lower floor of the tower, the View Room, is modeled after a traditional Native American kiva, and hosts cultural\u00a0demonstrations by indigenous artists during spring, summer and fall. A Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store is also located here.<br /> <br /> Inside the Watchtower View Room, views of the canyon,\u00a0through the different windows, are enhanced by looking through reflectoscopes\u00a0\u2014viewing instruments that use\u00a0polished black glass mirrors to cut\u00a0through the haze and glare of bright sunlight\u00a0and more clearly highlight\u00a0the canyon's multi-colored layers.<br /> <br /> The View Room, which for years was used as retail space, in 2015 was returned to the open area that Mary Colter had intended, because the room was originally designed to be a rest area. It was here that visitors to the canyon in the 1930\u2019s could sit in comfort and have outstanding views of the canyon. The fireplace is unique in that it does not block the view for visitors. Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>\u201cFirst and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.\u201d</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the\u00a0<em>\u201cweathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls\u201d.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company. Upon this framework, each exterior stone was selected and carefully placed to ensure exactly the look that Mary Colter was hoping to obtain.</p> <h3>Traveling to the Watchtower\u00a0</h3> <p><strong>Park Shuttles are NOT provided to Desert View.\u00a0You must drive you vehicle, or take a </strong><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/plan/interpretive-bus-tours/\">commercial bus tour</a>,\u00a0that starts from Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> The 23 mile (37 km) drive east of Grand Canyon Village on Arizona Highway 64 is worth the effort. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-drive.htm\">Desert View Drive</a> offers spectacular perspectives of the canyon, including:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Six developed canyon viewpoints</li> <li>Four picnic areas\u00a0</li> <li>Five unmarked pullouts\u00a0</li> <li>Accessibility for private vehicles\u00a0</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/tusayan-ruin-trail.htm\">Tusayan Pueblo Site and Museum</a> - Open Thursday through Monday</li> </ul> <p><br /> There is NO lodging at Desert View, although there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-campground.htm\">seasonal campground</a> operated by the National Park Service from mid-April to mid-October.</p> <h3>Desert View Visitor Services</h3> <p>Desert View provides restrooms, the Watchtower, Trading Post/ice cream/coffee, Grocery Store/Deli, Gas Station, and Campground. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view.htm\">Details ></a><br /> <br /> <strong>Cultural handicraft demonstrations take place in the Watchtower in the Spring, Summer and Fall.\u00a0</strong>The program provides an opportunity for visitors to interact with Tribal artisans from Grand Canyon's Traditionally Associated Tribes, and for them to share their history, knowledge and skills.\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-cultural-demonstration-program.htm\">View the Schedule ></a></em></p>",

Initially owned and operated by the Fred Harvey company in conjunction with the Santa Fe Railway, many considered it the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi River.<br /> <br /> In 1987, the hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark.</p>",

The realization of preserving trails and historic buildings, delivering educational programs for the public, conducting scientific research, and protecting wildlife and their natural habitat has been cultivated, in part, through GCC's memberships, publications, educational outreach, park stores, philanthropic efforts, and a field institute featuring guided natural and cultural history programs.<br /> <br /> Your purchases at each GCC Park Store will support these and many other initiatives in Grand Canyon. A GCC membership provides you with a 15% discount on all purchases at any of GCC bookstores in the park. In addition, your membership may allow for separate discounts at other park\u00a0cooperating associations and stores on separate federal public lands.</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Conservancy (GCC) Stores</h3> <p><strong>GCC operates multiple Park Stores in the park:</strong><br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center<br /> Kolb Studio<br /> Tusayan Museum and Ruin<br /> Desert View Watchtower<br /> North Rim Visitor Center</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Field Institute</h3> <p>The Grand Canyon Conservancy Field Institute helps visitors experience Grand Canyon like never before. Through classes, guided hiking trips, and educational tours you will learn about the geology and cultural and natural history of this magnificent place from those who know it best-geologists, historians, ecologists, archaeologists, and other experts.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>In 1932, park ranger naturalist Edwin \"Eddie\" McKee founded the Grand Canyon Natural History Association. As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its\u00a0beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>",

It also provides especially fantastic aerial views of the switchbacks on the upper and middle portions of Bright Angel Trail, as well as a view of 3-Mile Resthouse far below. Grandeur Point is a\u00a0popular stop along the Rim Trail between Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village, as well as\u00a0a popular spot for sunset that is often less crowded and\u00a0more easily accessible spots like Mather, Lipan,\u00a0or Hopi Points.<br /> <br /> Grandeur Point is located along the Rim Trail about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of Yavapai Point and Yavapai Geology Museum. It can also be reached via Parking Lot A and Park Headquarters by following the paved trail past McKee Amphitheater and out to the Rim Trail. After following this path for 0.4 miles (0.6 km), turn right and follow the Rim Trail east for nearly 0.5 miles (0.8 km). The view is worth the walk!</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Grandeur Point offers an especially dramatic view of Bright Angel Canyon, which slices directly across Grand Canyon and cuts deep into both the South and North Rims. Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and\u00a0small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear\u00a0cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago. Since its initial formation, the Bright Angel Fault has been reactivated several times, sometimes as a normal fault (such as it is now) and sometimes as a reverse and/or strike-slip fault.<br /> \u00a0</p>",

It is located along Desert View Drive (SR 64), halfway between Grand Canyon Village (10.2 miles/16.4 K) and Desert View (13.8 miles/22.2 K). The viewpoint offers breathtaking panoramic views of the canyon and is known for stunning sunrises and sunsets.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:\u00a0</strong><br /> Elevation: Grandview Point is approximately 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) above sea level, making it one of the highest points along the South Rim.\u00a0From Grandview Point, travelers can see vast expanses of the canyon, including the Colorado River and the layers of colorful rock strata that reveal the geological history of the area.</p> <p><strong>Visitor Facilities:</strong><br /> At the overlook, there are parking areas and vault toilets available. Drinking water is not available.</p> <p><strong>Safety Considerations:\u00a0</strong><br /> Due to its elevation and the rugged terrain, visitors should wear appropriate footwear and be cautious near the canyon\u2019s edge.</p> <p><strong>Historic Trail:</strong><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/grandview-trail.htm\">Grandview Trail</a> starts here at the scenic overlook and plunges steeply into the canyon. Originally constructed in the late 1800s, this trail served mining operations, enabling the transport of copper ore using burros and mules.<br /> <br /> Today the trail is popular with hikers looking for a more rugged experience. <strong>Trail Difficulty: Hard/Strenous.\u00a0</strong><br /> <br /> During summer, much of the trail is in full sun. In winter, ice and snow make hiking treacherous. Always use caution on the Grandview Trail and consult a park ranger at one of the visitor centers or the Backcountry Information Center for the latest weather and trail conditions.</p>",
