Hikers may see evidence of displaced <a>communities</a><a href=\"#_msocom_1\">[SS1]</a> and the remnants of the area\u2019s many historic churches, homesteads, farms, orchards, and sawmills.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Lakeview Drive is located in Swain County, North Carolina. Like residents of all counties bordering the park, Swain County families experienced emotional loss in the 1930s when they had to leave their homes and farms to make way for the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Hardly a decade later, in 1942 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fontana-dam.htm\">Fontana Dam\u2019s</a> construction by Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began and forced some Swain County families who had relocated outside of the park boundaries to relocate yet again. TVA purchased some tracts of land and forced residents of others out by eminent domain. TVA constructed Fontana Dam by wartime necessity to generate electricity for Oak Ridge, TN and the top-secret <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mapr/planyourvisit/oakridge-tn.htm\">Manhattan Project</a>. Construction of the hydroelectric dam was completed in 1945. With the dam in place, the Little Tennessee River was flooded, and Fontana Lake was formed over an area previously inhabited by over 1,000 residents in the towns of Proctor, Judson, Fontana and surrounding areas.<br /> <br /> In 1943, the 44,170 acres of land acquired by TVA for the construction of Fontana Dam and the subsequent formation of Fontana Lake was transferred to the Department of the Interior and incorporated into Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The same agreement that facilitated this land transfer also included a provision to construct Lakeview Drive along the north shore of the newly formed lake. This road was intended to reconnect displaced residents with cemeteries and other important community sites that were now located across the 17-mile-long Fontana Lake.Construction of Lakeview Drive, then known as North Shore Road, began in the 1960s. However, due to slope instability, high costs, and significant environmental challenges, the project was halted in 1972 and never completed. In 2007, the National Park Service agreed to a $52 million cash settlement with Swain County to honor the original 1943 agreement regarding the road\u2019s completion. The federal government fulfilled the settlement payments in full by 2017.<br /> <br /> The road now serves as a scenic getaway that showcases footprints of homesteads still honored by descendants and highlights the sacrifice of these communities to the formation of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the construction of Fontana Dam.</p> <h3>Detailed Directions\u00a0</h3> <p>From the Swain County Visitor Center and Heritage Museum in downtown Bryson City, follow Everett Street north and continue on Fontana Road for about 2.5 miles until you reach Lakeview Drive entrance.<br /> Mile 3.2: Fontana Lake Overlook has 8 parking spaces, 1 picnic table, and 1 trash can.<br /> Mile 5.0: Access to Noland Creek Trail and Benton McKaye Trail with 21 parking spaces.<br /> Mile 5.4: No trail access, 6 parking spaces.<br /> Mile 5.7: Access to Lakeview Drive Tunnel, Tunnel Bypass Trail, Goldmine Loop Trail, and Lakeshore Trail with 12 parking spaces.</p> <h3>Length\u00a0</h3> <p>11.4 miles (18.3 km) roundtrip</p> <h3>Parking\u00a0</h3> <p><a>Parking availability varies by overlook. </a>Don\u2019t forget <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">your parking tag</a>.</p> <h3>Nearest Restroom\u00a0</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/deep-creek-picnic-area.htm\">Deep Creek Picnic Area (open seasonally)</a></p> <h2>Similar Routes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-cosby-to-i-40.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Cosby to I-40)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-chilhowee-to-walland.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Chilhowee to Walland)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drive-foothills-parkway-walland-to-wears-valley.htm\">Foothills Parkway (Walland to Wears Valley)</a><br /> \u00a0</p>",
