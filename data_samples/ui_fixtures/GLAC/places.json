Firefighters strove to put out all fires, no matter the cause or location. As fire managers learned more about forest ecology, they understood that some fire is necessary for the health of the forest. Without regular fires, fuels build up and forests become more volatile. Today, fire managers often use fire as a tool and, under the correct conditions, may allow fire to play its natural role in the ecosystem. \u00a0<br /> <br /> Large fires in 1910 set the tone for fire management. The U.S. Forest Service saw fire as the enemy and adopted suppression as the rule. The National Park Service followed their example.\u00a0By the 1930s, Glacier had become very good at suppression. The New Deal provided additional funds and labor to the NPS in the 1930s, and suppression efforts were more successful than ever.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In the next few decades, a more scientific approach to fire developed. Reports discussed the crucial role fire played in maintaining healthy forest ecosystems, and policies began to adjust.\u00a0A new science-based directive for fire management began guiding the National Park Service in 1977. The policy allowed parks to use fire as a management tool, at their discretion.\u00a0<br /> <br /> A major fire year across the West, 1988 tested the new NPS management policies. Fire policy in the 1990s prioritized public and firefighter safety, while emphasizing fire\u2019s importance.\u00a0Our fire management history has been in turns emotional, scientific, and a balance of the two. Policies tend to change faster than the public perspective though, and emotional responses to fire still remain.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0",

Over a photo of grey and blue smoke, one large map depicts all the boundaries of major fires from 1910-2015. Then, below the larger map, three smaller maps split up fire boundaries from 1910-1926, in cream, 1927-1987, in light orange, and 1988-2015, in darker orange. From 1910-1926, fires mostly border the southern and western boundaries of the park. From 1927-1987, fewer total acres appear to have burned, and fires seem to have occurred where previous major fires hadn\u2019t been recorded. From 1988-2015, large swaths bordering the park\u2019s western boundary again burned, along with patches through the middle and eastern side of the park.

Fire is unique because it favors certain species to grow back.\u00a0<br /> <br /> As you hike, look for pink fireweed and other wildflowers that reseed an area after a fire. Beargrass, which is a small grassy tuft with a tall, white, Dr. Seuss-like flower, easily resprouts from its roots after a burn.\u00a0<br /> <br /> If you\u2019re here in the fall, keep an eye out for larch trees\u2014they look like evergreens, but their needles turn bright golden in October and November. Their thick bark helps mature trees survive a fire when other trees may not.

In the summer, grizzlies are often seen churning up meadows, looking for food like glacier lily bulbs and ground squirrels. Bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plans and meat. You might be surprised to learn that in Glacier National Park, most of a grizzly bear\u2019s diet is plants, especially berries.\u00a0During the winter months, when food is nearly nonexistent, bears will hibernate, living off fat reserves.<br /> <br /> Grizzly bears depend on high energy foods to get them through their long hibernation in winter. The meadows the grizzly bears depend on to find their yummy plants and roots are being filled in with trees. It seems that the warmer the climate gets, the more trees that can move into the meadows. Also, foods like whitebark pine nuts help the bears to build up enough fat to hibernate through the winter. These pine nuts have all but disappeared in Glacier because of a disease called white pine blister rust that is killing the whitebark pine trees. Bears have to find other foods to replace the nutritious pine nuts they used to depend on. Protected places like Glacier National Park provide a diversity of food sources for these super excavators.</p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{142}\" paraid=\"1369756085\"><br /> <strong>Mountain Explorer (Wolverine)\u00a0</strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{160}\" paraid=\"784035435\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Wolverines are super explorers. They routinely travel hundreds of miles a week through some of the most remote regions of the park. As they explore their territory and look for food, even the high peaks like Mt. Cleveland are no obstacle. One male wolverine climbed 5,000 feet in 90 minutes on his way up and over the summer.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Researchers in Glacier National Park have found that the deep snow covers up their burrows where they have their babies in the middle of winter. The air trapped in the snow makes it act like a blanket over the cold ground, keeping their burrows cozy for their young. Wolverines may suffer if they cannot find enough places with deep snow that they can burrow underground into to have shelter for their families. Right now, protected places like Glacier National Park provide important strongholds for these super explorers.</p>",

If you\u2019re continuing your drive over Going-to-the-Sun Road, another classic view of a cirque can be seen at Bird Woman Falls overlook, where the falls flows out of a cirque below Oberlin Mountain.<br /> <br /> U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, ar\u00eates, horns, moraines, paternoster lakes, cirques, and tarns are all evidence of a glaciated landscape. Although the glaciers that remain today aren't as colossal as the ones from the ice age, they contribute to changes in the park that will continue as time goes on.",

Before Glacier National Park was established in 1910, oil wells could be seen below active glaciers. \u00a0<br /> \u00a0<br /> Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that warms the planet. High elevation areas like Logan Pass are warming much faster than the global average, causing glacier retreat here and around the globe. \u00a0<br /> \u00a0<br /> Charted below in red, you can see that since early drillers moved into this area the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen sharply. \u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{186}\" paraid=\"2005846129\">If the old stories are true, early prospectors were lured to natural oil seeps in Glacier by bears that had wallowed in the \u201cblack gold.\u201d In 1892, a local paper presumed that this was \u201cthe only case where bears have been the guides of men to valuable deposits beneath the surface of the earth.\u201d \u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{192}\" paraid=\"303837474\">By the end of 1901, the Butte Oil Company had started drilling Montana\u2019s first oil well at the head of Kintla Lake in what is now the northwest corner of the park. Others thought they would find fortune by drilling in the Many Glacier Valley, pictured here. \u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{206}\" paraid=\"1931252613\">But the dream of riches did not pan out. One prospector was able to pipe just enough gas to burn for warmth in the winter. No one else did much better. The eager team at Kintla only ever found enough to get their hopes up. Then, sometime in the winter of 1902-1903, the accidental ignition of leaking gas sparked a fire that destroyed their whole operation. What little oil they had found, along with their buildings and equipment, went up in a cloud of black smoke.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{212}\" paraid=\"1547221170\">\u00a0<br /> The oil boom ended by the time the park was established, but carbon dioxide molecules released in that fire are still in the atmosphere, adding to the 421 parts per million (ppm) recorded in 2022, warming the Earth and melting the glaciers.\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{218}\" paraid=\"1921080659\">\u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{222}\" paraid=\"151974625\"><strong>A Century of Concerns\u00a0</strong><br /> <br /> \u201cAn atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature,\u201d wrote Eunice Foote in 1856. Her research is the first known to have demonstrated the existence of greenhouse gases. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were consistently around 280 ppm for about 6,000 years.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0<br /> \u201cThe burning of coal, oil, and natural gas,\u201d is releasing carbon dioxide and warming the climate, announced a 1965 report from the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. These changes \u201ccould be deleterious from the point of view of human beings,\u201d the Johnson report cautioned.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{234}\" paraid=\"1020188572\">\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that we should anticipate substantial climate change during the next several decades as a result of man\u2019s impact on the composition of the atmosphere.\u201d That was the warning from NASA scientist, Dr. James Hansen to Congress in March, 1982.\u00a0<br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\">The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 421 parts per million (ppm) in 2022, the highest concentration in human history. \u201cWe have known about this for half a century, and have failed to do anything meaningful about it,\u201d said senior NOAA scientist, Pieter Tans.<br /> \u00a0</p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\"><br /> <br /> <strong>Solutions & Benefits</strong><br /> \u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{184}\" paraid=\"2118420953\">How did you get here? It\u2019s likely that burning fossil fuels was your only choice for traveling to Logan Pass. That is how it\u2019s been for most visitors since Going-to-the-Sun Road first opened in 1933. For over a century, fossil fuels have taken us anywhere we wanted to go.</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{190}\" paraid=\"231760022\">\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{194}\" paraid=\"1123800208\">Though unintended, burning these fuels releases greenhouse gases that warm the climate. Limiting this warming requires shifting away from fossil fuels. Besides mitigating climate change, there are many other benefits to this transition.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{200}\" paraid=\"1440137662\">\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{204}\" paraid=\"1875596129\">Electric vehicles and appliances powered by renewable energy are more efficient, quieter, and safer. Fossil fuels may have been your only choice today, but alternatives\u2014and their side benefits\u2014are quickly becoming widespread.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{210}\" paraid=\"124154471\">\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{214}\" paraid=\"1817486045\">For these reasons and more, Glacier National Park has already begun an effort to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. From remote areas like Polebridge and Goat Haunt to busy hubs like the Apgar Visitor Center and park headquarters, Glacier is transitioning to renewable sources of energy.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{220}\" paraid=\"117018904\">\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{224}\" paraid=\"772085794\">The Logan Pass Visitor Center showcases these efforts.

A hardy crew of craftsmen overcame the difficulties of building what was then Montana's largest hotel while withstanding winter temperatures below zero degrees in order to have the hotel completed for a July 4, 1915 opening. Most of the timber for the hotel was logged from nearby and milled at a sawmill on the shores of Swiftcurrent Lake.

At the end of August, they go into a special type of sleep called hibernation. From September through May, they snooze underground. Would you like to sleep through the whole school year? To survive that long without eating, they need lots of fat, so they spend the summer gorging themselves on plants.\u00a0</p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{119}\" paraid=\"1574642640\">Marmots spend their whole lives in the alpine. They live in boulder fields, called talus, or in rocky meadows. They are skilled burrowers that spend most of their lives (80%) underground. During the summer, marmots use their burrows to raise their young, and to escape from predators. In winter, the deep snow that piles up over their burrows is important because it\u2019s like a white blanket, keeping the ground warmer when the air temperatures above the snow get super cold. A low snow year means a \u201cthinner blanket\u201d for keeping the marmot\u2019s burrow from freezing. Every super power has a weakness, and for the marmot it is being able to put on enough fat during the short summers to survive their long hibernation. Young marmots can lose half of their body weight during hibernation! Not to mention that while they are sound asleep underground in winter, they can become easy prey to a hungry, super-exploring wolverine. The adventures of this super sleeper will continue to be played out here in Glacier National Park.<br /> <br /> <strong>Super Reaper (Pika)\u00a0</strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{141}\" paraid=\"308543899\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Pikas cut and gather grass and wildflowers all summer. These small-but-mighty super reapers store grass and flowers in large piles, to eat during the long winter. One 5-ounce pika can reap 30 pounds of food each summer. That\u2019s 100 times its body weight! If you had a super-reaping power, which food would you store up?\u00a0<br /> <br /> These super reapers require a cold climate. Pikas have difficulty keeping their bodies from over-heating if it gets too warm outside. Temperatures can reach higher than 90 degrees where they live in their alpine habitats. As their climate gets warmer each year, it may become too warm for them, and they may disappear. Glacier National Park researchers and citizen scientists monitor these super reapers to help understand more about how they survive as\u00a0climate changes the way they live.</p>",

It\u2019s almost like they can be invisible. They get two sets of feathers every year: a brown set for summer and a white set for winter. That way, they can be camouflaged year-round. The super hiding power of their feathers helps to keep them from being eaten by predators.\u00a0<br /> <br /> With their super hiding powers, you may hear ptarmigan before you see them. One of this super power\u2019s weaknesses is that it can be very talkative when it\u2019s with ptarmigan friends. They blow their own cover! Ptarmigan change color when they sense the shorter days and colder temperatures of winter coming.\u00a0The ptarmigan\u2019s invisibility cloak of white feathers won\u2019t help it if it rains in winter instead of snows. The ground will be brown and the ptarmigan will have turned white. That makes it easy for one of their arch enemy predators to find them! Like the super reaper pika, ptarmigan have lived so long in the cold that their bodies can\u2019t get rid of heat when it gets too hot.\u00a0Ptarmigan need snow banks to keep cool by and little trickles of water nearby throughout the summer.\u00a0Protected places like Glacier National Park are providing clues to the ability of animals like the super hider ptarmigan to change with a changing climate.</p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{102}\" paraid=\"445886715\"><br /> <strong>Super Seekers (Weasel)\u00a0</strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{118}\" paraid=\"1888662686\"><em>Did You Know? </em>Weasels are super seekers. Their fur changes from brown in the summer to white in the winter, so they blend in with the background all year long. Their long, sleek bodies are low to the ground, allowing them to sneak up on prey long before being seen. Small mammals and birds need to be on the alert to avoid these super seekers.\u00a0\u00a0<br /> <br /> This super power\u2019s weakness, like the ptarmigan\u2019s, may be to change color and be white when it hasn\u2019t yet snowed. Then they would also be more visible to other predators looking to eat them.\u00a0That would be a good thing for the other predator! For the weasel, their super seeking power wouldn\u2019t work as well if they weren\u2019t camouflaged.\u00a0It would be a lot harder to sneak up on its prey.\u00a0</p>",

They use their power each fall during contests for females. The strongest head-banger wins.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Bighorn sheep\u00a0need wide, open spaces, unobstructed by trees. They want to be able to see long distances so they have lots of time to get away from their predators. As the climate warms, and the alpine meadows in Glacier National Park are filled with trees, sheep will have less open space.\u00a0Sheep populations can also be weakened by disease.

They also have a rough concave pad on the bottom of each tow that helps them grip steep cliffs.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Although they are super climbers, the steep areas they live in are also places with lots of avalanches. When those huge slabs of snow slide down the mountainside, mountain goats can be caught in their destructive paths.\u00a0Also, in order to live in these high peaks, goats have warm thick coats to survive the cold temperatures in the winter. They shed these coats in summer but still need snowfields and shaded places to stay cool in as summer temperatures heat up.

    "bodyText": "Situated amid Montana\u2019s prairieland, the plains surrounding the St. Mary Visitor Center are a stark difference between the mountains behind it. The abrupt change is evidence of dramatic folding and faulting that crumpled and deformed the earth\u2019s crust to uplift the mountains we see today. Much of this activity took place from about 150 million years ago to about 60 million years ago.<br /> <br /> The many-colored rocks you see in the park\u2019s mountains today formed as sediments, slowly building up on an ancient sea floor. These rocks are almost 1.5 <i>billion</i> years old! Tectonic forces pushed and uplifted this thick stack of rock up and over much younger rocks that are only 70 million<i> </i>years old. They would slide 50 miles (80 km) eastward to their present location along a fault called the Lewis overthrust. Where you see the dramatic change from prairie to mountains along the park\u2019s eastern boundary is roughly the outline of that once-active fault.<br /> <br /> <a><i>The St. Mary Visitor Center is the eastern gateway to the mountains of Glacier National Park. Rangers staff the visitor center throughout the summer, providing trip planning and other information about the park. While you\u2019re here, make sure to stop by the bathroom, fill up your water bottles, and grab your souvenirs from the Glacier National Park Conservancy\u2019s gift shop.</i></a>",

For some, this was a place to showcase to others.<br /> <br /> In 1910, the Great Northern Railway and others successfully lobbied Congress and President Taft to establish Glacier National Park. The park would need visitor accommodations, roads, and trails. The Great Northern Railway was the park\u2019s partner and funder of this massive project. Railway president, Louis Hill, saw this valley as one important site in his vision of developing the \u201cAlps of America\u201d into a tourist destination and enticing American tourists to \u201cSee America First.\u201d No vision is made reality without challenges and the Many Glacier Hotel was no exception.

    "bodyText": "Wild Goose Island is one of the most photographed scenes in Glacier. The tiny island, rising only 14 feet (4 m) above the surface of St. Mary Lake, is surrounded by towering mountains. Views like this in the St. Mary Valley and many other areas in the park are evidence of ancient glaciation.<br /> <br /> Over the past two million years, the Ice Age, or Pleistocene Epoch, saw large ice sheets repeatedly advance and retreat throughout North America. During the ice advances, the lower-elevation valleys were filled with glaciers and only the very tops of the higher mountain peaks were visible. Rivers of ice would glide throughout the mountains, sculpting them into a variety of landforms including the U-shaped valleys and jagged peaks we see today. In the area that would become Glacier National Park, the Ice Age ended about 10,000 years ago, and ice retreated from the area.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice so large they flow under their own weight. Like any other form of water, a glacier will follow the most direct course downhill, often flowing in areas previously filled by a river or stream. When a river erodes a valley into the mountains, it cuts a V-shaped profile. In contrast, a glacier scours valleys into a U-shape, broad at the base and sheer on the sides. Often, when the glacier retreats, it leaves behind a long, deep lake, like what you see as you gaze up the St. Mary Valley.",
