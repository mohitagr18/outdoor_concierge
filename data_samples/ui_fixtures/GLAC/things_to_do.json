Find more information on everything from the large and majestic elk of the prairies, to the small stonefly of glacier-fed streams on Glacier National Park's website.",
    "longDescription": "Glacier provides a wonderful opportunity to view animals in their natural habitat. However, when watching wildlife, it\u2019s important to remember to stay safe. Enjoy wildlife from the safety of your car or from a safe distance. Do not approach wildlife to take photographs. Visitors who have gotten too close to animals while trying to get a picture have been severely injured \u2014 use a telephoto lens instead. This will not only ensure your own safety, but also the safety of the wildlife. Feeding or harassing wildlife is strictly prohibited and subject to a fine.<br /> <br /> All wildlife can present a real threat, especially females with young and males during mating season. For most species, like moose, elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and deer, visitors must maintain at least 25 yards (23 m) of distance. For wolves, grizzly bears, black bears, and mountain lions, a distance of at least 100 yards (91 m) must be observed. For more information on exploring Glacier National Park safely, visit our website NPS.GOV/GLAC.",
