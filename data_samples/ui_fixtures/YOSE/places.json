    "listingDescription": "Although Yosemite was set aside as a national park in 1890, the National Park Service had not yet been created. Following the precedent set in Yellowstone, our country's first national park, the U.S. Army Cavalry also patrolled General Grant National Park (now known as Kings Canyon National Park) and Yosemite National Park. Each summer over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both parks.",
    "bodyText": "<p>Starting in 1891, U.S. Army soldiers were among the first guardians of the recently established Yosemite National Park, protecting the park for twenty-three years before the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park\u2019s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite\u2019s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent\u2019s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley. Later this building was moved to the Yosemite History Center.</p>",

    "listingDescription": "Tourist parties provided business for local residents. George Anderson, a miner and blacksmith, worked as a guide in the late 1800s, and escorted visitors on expeditions in Yosemite. In 1875, he was the first person to climb Half Dome. He spent his winters in this building at Big Meadow (now called Foresta), and his summers in Yosemite Valley.",
    "bodyText": "<p><i>\u201cHalf Dome was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of all the prominent points about Yosemite which has never been and will never be trodden by human foot.\u201d\u00a0</i>Josiah Whitney, California State Geologist, 1869</p> <p>George Anderson, a Scottish immigrant, came to Yosemite around 1868, working a variety of jobs to make ends meet in Yosemite Valley during the warm summer months. During the winter, Anderson lived in this\u00a0modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the \u201cperfectly inaccessible\u201d summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>",

Artists were drawn to Yosemite, where they found inspiration in the magnificent scenery. Paintings, drawings, sketches, and photographs publicized and popularized Yosemite. Consequently, many people chose to travel the arduous route to Yosemite and experience the beauty firsthand. Thus, artists played a key role in increased awareness, tourism, and protection.",
    "bodyText": "<p>Like many artists, Norwegian immigrant Chris Jorgensen fell in love with Yosemite\u2019s grandeur, and challenged himself to capture it on canvas. After visiting Yosemite for the first time in 1898, Jorgensen was granted permission to build a home and a studio on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley (near today's Sentinel Bridge). From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio. He loved plein air painting, or painting outdoors. Beyond providing shade, the umbrella he holds in the image below helped with color perception in the harsh sunlight.</p> <p>The bungalow in the Yosemite History Center, part of Jorgensen's Yosemite property, represents an era when artists were some of the best advocates for the preservation of wild places. Yosemite\u2019s landscapes inspired artists to create, and as they shared their art with those unable to experience nature\u2019s beauty first-hand, their creations inspired others to preserve Yosemite as a public park.</p> <p>Even today, Yosemite stirs visitors to connect creatively with the landscape. Photos, paintings, and written accounts of Yosemite are now more popular, and more shareable, than ever.</p>",

The cliffs and waterfalls will remain well into the future no matter what humans do. Changes caused by 150 years of tourism were rapid and damaging to the natural environment. Now with more deliberation, research, and care, it is clear that some resource damage can be corrected while enhancing the visitor experience. This may mean a change in the way we visit and experience this place. Changes in the future will help protect and restore the natural environment. The health of meadows, woodlands, and the river will improve. People of the world continue to increase their understanding, respect, and love of natural places, so the support needed to carry this work into the future seems assured.</p> <p>Can we learn from our experience here what it means to live harmoniously within landscapes and their natural and essential processes? Some of the biggest threats to Yosemite come from well beyond its borders. Perhaps the future success of preservation in Yosemite will depend upon sensitivity to the wonders of nature wherever we live. We can be thankful for our Yosemite experience, which has awakened us to nature's grand and minute wonders and reminded us that our fates are inextricably linked.</p>",

By August or September, Yosemite Falls is usually dry and the river flow is less than one percent of its spring maximum. Major floods occurred five times in the 20th century. Although flooding may be inconvenient for us, these waters are vitally important to meadows, wetlands, riparian zones, and river systems.</p> <p>The Merced River Plan provides direction for the protection and enhancement of this Wild and Scenic River and all of its \"Outstandingly Remarkable Values.\" Facilities will be removed from the floodplains where possible, and valuable natural habitat along the river will be restored. These include the immediate riparian areas - trees and shrubs along the riverbank - and meadow wetlands where the diversity of plants and animals is greatest. The river is the lifeblood of the Yosemite Valley ecosystem. This plan will ensure its health well into the future.</p> <p>What would you hope people's experience of Yosemite to be like in the future?</p>",

One hundred years ago, this cluster of trees was open meadow. New park plans call for reclaiming priceless, natural beauty and allowing natural processes to prevail. Now, interestingly, humans will affect change for the sake of restoration. Cook's Meadow has already been the focus of two important restoration projects - an old building site was re-contoured in 1993, and an old roadbed was removed in 1998. A wonderful surprise emerged when imported fill material was removed during the restoration: many species of native plants, including some rare and endangered species, sprouted from seeds dormant for nearly a century. These newly restored areas are carefully monitored and what is learned here will be applied to future meadow restoration projects.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The original guest registration building, now used as a lounge, is the oldest building in the Curry Village Historic District and the oldest concessioner-built structure in Yosemite. Constructed in 1904, it predates many of the Rustic buildings in Yosemite. As such, its massing and use of materials maintain some distinction from other designs throughout Yosemite. In particular, the shape of the roofline and wraparound covered deck are uncommon features of the area. Inside, exposed trusses along with paneled walls and ceilings set the design of this building apart from other rustic interiors in the park.</p> <p>The modern-day registration building was constructed as a post office in 1920 and shares many aesthetic similarities with the modern-day lounge building. It was modified to accommodate registration functions in 1959.</p>",

The original Stoneman Cabin burned down, and the current Stoneman House, built in 1913 was converted from a dance hall to guest rooms in the late 1960s.</p> <p>Its design echoes that of the lounge and registration building.

    "listingDescription": "John Degnan settled in Yosemite Valley in 1884, and began working as a laborer and caretaker for state administrators there. His wife, Bridget, added to the family income by selling bread she baked daily in Dutch ovens. As travel to Yosemite increased, the demand for her bread grew. A larger oven, capable of producing 50 loaves per day, was used until 1900, when the Degnans ordered a large brick oven for a more permanent bakery. This bakery was originally connected to the Deg",
    "bodyText": "<p>Irish immigrants Bridget and John Degnan, along with their infant son Laurence, moved to Yosemite Valley in the mid-1880s. Mountain living proved tough at first. The family first lived in an abandoned barn and had to carry household water from a nearby stream in a five-gallon oil can. Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12\u00bd cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services. Bridget's legacy continued when her children opened an even bigger bakery in 1958, still open today as Degnan's Kitchen in Yosemite Village. It remained family-owned until 1972.</p>",

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop. As you walk to the next stop, think back to the sign we saw at the beginning and recall that image of Yosemite Valley underwater.

    "bodyText": "<p>On March 26, 1872 the famed naturalist and conservationist, John Muir, was sleeping in a cabin nearby when he was shaken awake by a strong earthquake. This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872. As you make your way to the final stop on this tour, look around at the vast field of boulders and imagine the chaos that took place here just a few thousand years ago.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>As you made your way to this stop you surely noticed one of the most iconic features in Yosemite; the cascading waterfalls of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>",

The gigantic boulder in front of you now is from a rockfall that occurred about 3,000 years ago. This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls. Since glaciers retreated from Yosemite Valley, rockfalls became the dominant geological force eroding the cliffs and they still occur today. Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>On most days, the Merced River flows peacefully beneath Superintendents Bridge. However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars. The trail picks up at the far end of the parking lot next to the Chapel.</p>",

A short, paved, wheelchair-accessible trail takes you to a point 3,214 feet above Yosemite Valley's Curry Village, allowing views of Yosemite's high country.</p> <p>In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt went on a three-day guided wilderness trip through Yosemite with John Muir that started at the Mariposa Grove, and included Sentinel Dome, Glacier Point, and Yosemite Valley. Muir seized this opportunity \"to do some forest good in talking freely around the campfire,\" with the president. Buffalo Soldiers from the Ninth Cavalry Troop were there as presidential escorts, and were asked to clear the Four Mile Trail for the president's use, but Muir and Roosevelt had other plans and used that ploy to escape from their escorts!

As you near its base, look at the fires scars that remain. Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years.

Thomas \u201cTom\u201d Hodgdon acquired land for grazing cattle in Aspen Valley, now within Yosemite National Park. In 1879, Tom hired workers to build an access road, and a two-story cabin, on the land. To build the two-story log cabin, he hired a Chinese American cowboy named Ah Hoy and a neighbor named Franklin Babcock. The Hodgdon family, ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley, grazed cattled on their homesteaded land in Aspen Valley each summer.</p> <p>Tom and family ran a ranching business, grazing cattle in nearby meadows. After these meadows became part of Yosemite National Park in 1890, U.S. Army troops enforced park regulations against grazing by dispersing cattle, and the Hodgdons lost grazing privileges. The family didn\u2019t use the cabin for a while, and patrolling soldiers, and even Army horses, sheltered inside occasionally.</p> <p>No longer able to earn a living with livestock in Yosemite, the Hodgdon family adapted to make money from tourism. In 1882, as part of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, the Hodgdons\u2019 access road was improved upon by Chinese workers, and extended to Tioga Pass for silver mining. When the Tioga Road opened to the public, tourist traffic increased through Aspen Valley. The Hodgdon family used their cabin, and created a complex of new buildings, used for tourist lodging. Eliza Hodgdon, Tom\u2019s spouse, added to the entrepreneurial effort by selling hot meals to hungry travelers.</p>",

At its peak in late spring, 2,400 gallons per second can flow over the lip of the upper fall. <strong>While you can visit this trail and\u00a0viewing area\u00a0year-round, there is often no water in the waterfall\u00a0by late summer.\u00a0</strong></p> <p>In winter, a cone of ice accumulates at the base of\u00a0Upper Yosemite Fall, sometimes exceeding 300\u00a0feet tall.\u00a0The ice cone\u00a0is usually melted by mid-April.\u00a0In early spring, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/frazilice.htm\">frazil ice</a> sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when waterfall mist becomes very cool.</p> <p>When waterfall flow is especially high, generally in April and May, the full moon refracting light on the waterfall mist can create a phenomenon called a moonbow. The visibility of the moonbow is highly dependent on water flow, clear skies, and angle of the moon.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>The entire Lower Yosemite Fall loop trail is paved. The eastern part of the loop (0.6 mile one-way\u00a0from the Yosemite Falls shuttle stop to the viewing area) is accessible to wheelchairs and crosses several braided streams before reaching the Lower Yosemite Fall viewing area, which has transferable seating to granite boulders at wheelchair height.<br /> <br /> The western part of the loop (0.5 mile one-way to the viewing area) is wide enough for several people and is mostly accessible; however, a short, steep grade near the viewing area (the last 180 feet include a slope of 13.8%) may make assistance necessary for some visitors.<br /> <br /> An accessible restroom is located near the trailhead, on the western end of the loop\u00a0across the street from Yosemite Valley Lodge. The restroom facility has a designated family restroom that is also accessible.</p>",

Their duties were made more difficult by the fact that automobiles had been allowed to enter the park in August 1913. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a $5 fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations.",
    "bodyText": "<p>After twenty-three years protecting the park, the U.S. Army was called away from Yosemite in 1914, and civilians began to assume ranger roles. It was the job of these rangers to protect the natural resources, stop forest fires, and assist visitors. Their duties were made more difficult as automobiles had recently been allowed to enter the park.</p> <p>The ranger patrol cabin was built in 1915 to house rangers at Crane Flat, a busy road junction. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours. At Crane Flat and others Yosemite locations, rangers needed to live close to backcountry patrol routes and roadside stations where they assisted visitors arriving by automobile. In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the rangers living here became some of the first National Park Service Rangers.</p> <p>Gabriel Sovulewski, a Polish immigrant, embodied the administrative transition from the military to the National Park Service in Yosemite. He first saw Yosemite in 1895 while on a summer deployment to the park with the U.S. Army. In 1902, he left the Army and returned to Yosemite to work as a packer and guide. In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years. During that time he directed the construction of trails and buildings such as the Ranger Patrol Cabin. Gabriel Sovulewski remained in Yosemite for the rest of his life, and is buried next to his wife, Rose in the Yosemite Cemetery.</p>",

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985 for significance in the development of the Rustic style and is still in use today as a home for seasonal rangers.</p> <p>Sumner designed a large, modified chalet with wood shingles and steeply pitched roofs. Instead of leaving simple corners, every edge of the building is defined with heavy log pilasters, strengthening the connection between the building and surrounding forest edges.

    "listingDescription": "A steep climb is well rewarded with close-up views of Upper Yosemite Fall and distant views of Half Dome and other Sierra peaks. Along the hike, enjoy a bird's eye view of Yosemite Valley's meadows and the meandering Merced River. Enjoy the views from Columbia Rock, located one mile (and dozens of switchbacks) from the trailhead. The Yosemite Falls Trail is one of Yosemite's oldest historic trails, built 1873 to 1877.",
    "bodyText": "<p>One of Yosemite's oldest historic trails, built 1873 to 1877, the Yosemite Falls Trail leads to the top of the waterfall, which cascades 2,425 feet (739 m) above the Valley floor. This trail starts near Camp 4, along the\u00a0Valley Loop Trail, and immediately climbs a series of switchbacks\u00a0through oak woodland. Do not stray off of the maintained path, as you will find steep drops adjacent to the trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Use extreme caution when near the creek and remember you are directly above a waterfall.</strong></p> <h2>Columbia Rock</h2> <p>Columbia Rock features\u00a0views of Half Dome, Sentinel Rock, and the valley floor. From there, consider hiking another 0.5 miles (0.8 km) beyond this point for\u00a0a stunning view of Upper Yosemite Fall.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distance:</strong>\u00a02 miles (3.2 km) round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong>\u00a01,000 ft (328 m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Time estimate:</strong>\u00a02-3 hours round trip</p> <h2>Top of Yosemite Falls</h2> <p>The upper switchbacks of the trail is steep and rocky but very scenic, including views of Upper Yosemite Fall with Half Dome in the background.\u00a0The final portion of the hike leads\u00a0to a small viewing platform where Yosemite Creek pours over the lip of the cliff.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distance:</strong>\u00a07.2 miles (11.6 km) round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong>\u00a02,700 ft (820\u00a0m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Time estimate:</strong>\u00a06-8 hours round trip</p> <h2>Tips & Seasonal Information</h2> <p>Pets and bicycles are not allowed on hiking trails.\u00a0Do not shortcut switchbacks, which causes rapid trail erosion and results in injuries.<br /> <br /> The Yosemite Falls Trail can be hiked\u00a0year-round, though\u00a0conditions vary depending on the season. In spring, when the waterfall is at its peak, this hike is stunning, and you may even get wet from the spray of the waterfall during a section of the hike. In summer, conditions are hot and dry, and the loose decomposed granite along the trail can be slippery. Keep in mind that by August, the waterfall is typically low or totally dry.\u00a0During winter, the lower portion of this trail gets direct sunlight, so hiking can be snow-free while other trails are icy.<br /> <br /> Columbia Rock, located one mile up the trail, is a worthwhile trip at any time of year. Beyond this point, the upper portion of this trail receives little to no sunlight in winter and can be very icy and slippery, or buried beneath feet of snow, making traction difficult. In winter, hiking in the colder early morning or late afternoon hours can be even more dangerous if the trail is icy.</p>",

When there is adequate water, the mirror effect for which the lake is named is best viewed early in the morning, when the water is still.</p> <h2>Tips & Seasonal Information</h2> <p><strong>While you may visit this area any time of year, the lake is typically only present in spring and early summer.</strong> As summer wears on, the shallow lake gradually disappears into the sand in late summer,\u00a0transforming into \"Mirror Meadow.\" All times of year, the views of Half Dome and other nearby cliffs are remarkable.<br /> <br /> Leashed pets, bicycles, and strollers are allowed on the paved pathways leading toward this viewpoint. Beyond that, on unpaved areas,\u00a0they are prohibited. A pit toilet is available where the paved road ends, near the views of Mirror Lake.<br /> <br /> <strong>Caution:\u00a0</strong>During spring and early summer, when water levels are highest, entering the water can be dangerous.\u00a0Always remember when approaching moving water to look at the conditions downstream. Waters in this area may appear ankle deep at first, but can quickly become thigh deep, and, all too often, hikers are swept into dangerous whitewater and pinned against rocks.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/photosmultimedia/swiftwater.htm\">Learn more</a>\u00a0about past experiences visitors had with swift water in this area of the park.</p> <h2>Accessibility\u00a0</h2> <p>A one-mile road, from the Mirror Lake shuttle stop, leads to this view of the lake and is easy to walk due to its paved surface. The last 1,000 feet of the trail up to the lake is on a slope from 6.6 percent to 10.6 percent.<br /> <br /> Vehicles with a disability placard are permitted to drive up to 15 mph, with hazard lights on, to Mirror Lake. Be cautious as the road is shared with bicyclists and hikers. There are two designated accessible parking spaces available.</p>",

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln\u2019s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father\u2019s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father\u2019s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.\u2019s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.<br /> <br /> <em>Source</em>: \"Yosemite National Park,\" <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/yosemite-national-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <br /> For more information and primary resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4157,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157670860792970/\">Olmsted Archives on Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/08204\">Olmsted Online</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Yosemite Transportation Office was constructed in Yosemite Valley in 1910 by the Yosemite Valley Railroad Company as a transportation terminal and telecommunications hub.</p> <p>Starting in 1907, Yosemite-bound tourists could ride the railroad from Merced to El Portal, just outside the park, eliminating the bumpy, dusty, two-day stage ride. However, the final fourteen-mile leg of the journey from El Portal to Yosemite Valley was still made by stage, and later by autos.</p> <p>Upon arrival at this terminal in Yosemite Valley, passengers could book a stay in a hotel and make transportation arrangements with travel agents, who lived in the building\u2019s back rooms. Despite its rustic design, the office provided modern conveniences. Visitors could make telephone calls or send telegrams to anywhere in the world. By 1914, automobiles were common in Yosemite, and in that year, horse-drawn stage service was discontinued. However, annual visitation to the park in 1915 doubled to 31,000. Consequently, stage operation was renewed but only for one additional year. In 1916, the era of stage travel ended and another began. The National Park Service, a federal agency created to preserve and manage our country's national parks, was established.</p> <p>The reliance on transportation companies for park access diminished greatly when the All-Year Highway (now California Highway 140) opened in 1927, and personal cars soon became the dominant means of transportation in Yosemite.</p>",
