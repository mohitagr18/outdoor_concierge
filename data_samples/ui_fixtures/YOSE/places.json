    "listingDescription": "Although Yosemite was set aside as a national park in 1890, the National Park Service had not yet been created. Following the precedent set in Yellowstone, our country's first national park, the U.S. Army Cavalry also patrolled General Grant National Park (now known as Kings Canyon National Park) and Yosemite National Park. Each summer over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both parks.",
    "bodyText": "<p>Starting in 1891, U.S. Army soldiers were among the first guardians of the recently established Yosemite National Park, protecting the park for twenty-three years before the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park\u2019s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite\u2019s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent\u2019s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley. Later this building was moved to the Yosemite History Center.</p>",

    "listingDescription": "Tourist parties provided business for local residents. George Anderson, a miner and blacksmith, worked as a guide in the late 1800s, and escorted visitors on expeditions in Yosemite. In 1875, he was the first person to climb Half Dome. He spent his winters in this building at Big Meadow (now called Foresta), and his summers in Yosemite Valley.",
    "bodyText": "<p><i>\u201cHalf Dome was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of all the prominent points about Yosemite which has never been and will never be trodden by human foot.\u201d\u00a0</i>Josiah Whitney, California State Geologist, 1869</p> <p>George Anderson, a Scottish immigrant, came to Yosemite around 1868, working a variety of jobs to make ends meet in Yosemite Valley during the warm summer months. During the winter, Anderson lived in this\u00a0modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the \u201cperfectly inaccessible\u201d summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>",

Artists were drawn to Yosemite, where they found inspiration in the magnificent scenery. Paintings, drawings, sketches, and photographs publicized and popularized Yosemite. Consequently, many people chose to travel the arduous route to Yosemite and experience the beauty firsthand. Thus, artists played a key role in increased awareness, tourism, and protection.",
    "bodyText": "<p>Like many artists, Norwegian immigrant Chris Jorgensen fell in love with Yosemite\u2019s grandeur, and challenged himself to capture it on canvas. After visiting Yosemite for the first time in 1898, Jorgensen was granted permission to build a home and a studio on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley (near today's Sentinel Bridge). From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio. He loved plein air painting, or painting outdoors. Beyond providing shade, the umbrella he holds in the image below helped with color perception in the harsh sunlight.</p> <p>The bungalow in the Yosemite History Center, part of Jorgensen's Yosemite property, represents an era when artists were some of the best advocates for the preservation of wild places. Yosemite\u2019s landscapes inspired artists to create, and as they shared their art with those unable to experience nature\u2019s beauty first-hand, their creations inspired others to preserve Yosemite as a public park.</p> <p>Even today, Yosemite stirs visitors to connect creatively with the landscape. Photos, paintings, and written accounts of Yosemite are now more popular, and more shareable, than ever.</p>",

The cliffs and waterfalls will remain well into the future no matter what humans do. Changes caused by 150 years of tourism were rapid and damaging to the natural environment. Now with more deliberation, research, and care, it is clear that some resource damage can be corrected while enhancing the visitor experience. This may mean a change in the way we visit and experience this place. Changes in the future will help protect and restore the natural environment. The health of meadows, woodlands, and the river will improve. People of the world continue to increase their understanding, respect, and love of natural places, so the support needed to carry this work into the future seems assured.</p> <p>Can we learn from our experience here what it means to live harmoniously within landscapes and their natural and essential processes? Some of the biggest threats to Yosemite come from well beyond its borders. Perhaps the future success of preservation in Yosemite will depend upon sensitivity to the wonders of nature wherever we live. We can be thankful for our Yosemite experience, which has awakened us to nature's grand and minute wonders and reminded us that our fates are inextricably linked.</p>",

By August or September, Yosemite Falls is usually dry and the river flow is less than one percent of its spring maximum. Major floods occurred five times in the 20th century. Although flooding may be inconvenient for us, these waters are vitally important to meadows, wetlands, riparian zones, and river systems.</p> <p>The Merced River Plan provides direction for the protection and enhancement of this Wild and Scenic River and all of its \"Outstandingly Remarkable Values.\" Facilities will be removed from the floodplains where possible, and valuable natural habitat along the river will be restored. These include the immediate riparian areas - trees and shrubs along the riverbank - and meadow wetlands where the diversity of plants and animals is greatest. The river is the lifeblood of the Yosemite Valley ecosystem. This plan will ensure its health well into the future.</p> <p>What would you hope people's experience of Yosemite to be like in the future?</p>",

One hundred years ago, this cluster of trees was open meadow. New park plans call for reclaiming priceless, natural beauty and allowing natural processes to prevail. Now, interestingly, humans will affect change for the sake of restoration. Cook's Meadow has already been the focus of two important restoration projects - an old building site was re-contoured in 1993, and an old roadbed was removed in 1998. A wonderful surprise emerged when imported fill material was removed during the restoration: many species of native plants, including some rare and endangered species, sprouted from seeds dormant for nearly a century. These newly restored areas are carefully monitored and what is learned here will be applied to future meadow restoration projects.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The original guest registration building, now used as a lounge, is the oldest building in the Curry Village Historic District and the oldest concessioner-built structure in Yosemite. Constructed in 1904, it predates many of the Rustic buildings in Yosemite. As such, its massing and use of materials maintain some distinction from other designs throughout Yosemite. In particular, the shape of the roofline and wraparound covered deck are uncommon features of the area. Inside, exposed trusses along with paneled walls and ceilings set the design of this building apart from other rustic interiors in the park.</p> <p>The modern-day registration building was constructed as a post office in 1920 and shares many aesthetic similarities with the modern-day lounge building. It was modified to accommodate registration functions in 1959.</p>",

He was the son of the founders and was enthusiastic about adding traditional cabin lodging. This era was short-lived, however, with concessioner leadership ultimately preferring the traditional tent cabins. The original Stoneman Cabin burned down, and the current Stoneman House, built in 1913 was converted from a dance hall to guest rooms in the late 1960s.</p> <p>Its design echoes that of the lounge and registration building.

    "listingDescription": "John Degnan settled in Yosemite Valley in 1884, and began working as a laborer and caretaker for state administrators there. His wife, Bridget, added to the family income by selling bread she baked daily in Dutch ovens. As travel to Yosemite increased, the demand for her bread grew. A larger oven, capable of producing 50 loaves per day, was used until 1900, when the Degnans ordered a large brick oven for a more permanent bakery. This bakery was originally connected to the Deg",
    "bodyText": "<p>Irish immigrants Bridget and John Degnan, along with their infant son Laurence, moved to Yosemite Valley in the mid-1880s. Mountain living proved tough at first. The family first lived in an abandoned barn and had to carry household water from a nearby stream in a five-gallon oil can. Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12\u00bd cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services. Bridget's legacy continued when her children opened an even bigger bakery in 1958, still open today as Degnan's Kitchen in Yosemite Village. It remained family-owned until 1972.</p>",
