Today, we value the quiet majesty of these giant sequoias and share a responsibility as park stewards to limit our impact on them.",

Sequoias do not have deep tap roots; instead the roots spread out near the grounds' surface to capture water. While the roots are usually no deeper than six feet (2 meters), they can fan out more than 150 feet (45 meters), providing a stable base to balance the massive trunk. When visitors stay on the road and trails, it minimizes soil compaction that damages these surface roots.",
