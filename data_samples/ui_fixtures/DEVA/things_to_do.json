    "shortDescription": "Roadrunners and ravens and hummingbirds- oh my! With many resident and migratory species, bird watching opportunities abound in Death Valley.",
    "longDescription": "Death Valley is a birder's paradise due to the sheer number of species which can be spotted in the park. One of the largest contributers to this diversity is the huge range of elevations and associated habitats present (over 11,000 ft/ 3353 m). From the creosote-studded sands of Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, to the riparian oasis at Darwin Falls, to the bristlecone forest crowning Telescope Peak, many habitat types mean many bird species which call Death Valley home.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In addition to year-round residents such as ravens and roadrunners, Death Valley's water sources are also a vital resource for migratory birds, many of which can be spotted in the spring and fall.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Spring Migration</strong><br /> For a few weeks in the spring, hundreds of species pass through desert areas. The first of the northbound spring migrants can be seen as early as the beginning of March, with migration fully ramping up by mid-March to early April. The first wave of warblers reaches the valley about mid-April. The northbound movement reaches its peak from late April to early May.<br /> <br /> <strong>Nesting</strong><br /> Nesting occurs from mid-February (during warm springs) at lower elevations, through July at higher elevations. May through June is the most productive nesting period.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fall Migration</strong><br /> There is definite evidence that the fall migration is underway by early August. Southbound movements are at a peak near the end of September. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between northbound and southbound movements. Late spring migrants may still be moving north as early fall migrants begin their southward journeys. There is also the post-nesting summering visitors which may be mistaken for early southbound migrants.<br /> <br /> <strong>Winter</strong><br /> November through March is probably the poorest season for birding; a few permanent residents remain, as well as occasional Sierran visitors. The majority of the park's avifauna can be found at the low mountain springs and desert oases. Furnace Creek Ranch, with its diversity of habitats is a hot spot. Springs occuring up to approximatley 4,000 feet (1,219 m) elevation are also common wintering habitats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where to look for birds</strong><br /> Visiting the following areas provides an overview of the diversity of Death Valley habitat and avian species:<br /> <br /> Saratoga Spring (60 ft. elevation)\u2013 a low desert oasis.<br /> <br /> Furnace Creek Ranch (-200 ft. elev.) \u2013 multiple lush habitats; visit the bird viewing platform next to Airport Road. <em>Note: please do not enter the golf course unless golfing.</em><br /> <br /> Scotty\u2019s Castle (3,000 ft. elev.) \u2013 riparian habitat.\u00a0<em>(currently closed due to flooding)</em><br /> <br /> Wildrose (4,000 ft. elev.) \u2013 riparian habitat.<br /> <br /> High Panamints: Charcoal Kilns to the top of Telescope Peak (elevations from 7,000 \u2013 11,000 ft)\u2013 this challenging drive / hike passes through pinyon-juniper habitat to bristlecone pine communities (recommended during clear / non-snow conditions only).<br /> <br /> Use this Death Valley <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/upload/DEVA-Bird-List-508.pdf\">bird list</a> to keep track of species you observe.",

    "longDescription": "<p>Did you know that Death Valley National Park has no closing time and that it is just as spectacular at night as it is during the day? Instead of leaving right after sunset, consider experiencing the park at night:</p> <h4>Star Gazing</h4> <p>Far from cities and carefully managed to protect darkness, Death Valley National Park is an excellent place to view the night sky. Nights in Death Valley are so dark that the park is classified at the highest (Gold Tier) level by the International Dark-Sky Association; many celestial objects which can be viewed from Death Valley are not visible elsewhere in the world! While most places in the park away from lodging/campgrounds and major roads will provide good night-sky viewing opportunities, here are a few top ranger suggestions for star gazing locations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes</p> </li> <li> <p>Harmony Borax Works</p> </li> <li> <p>Ubehebe Crater</p> </li> <li> <p>Badwater Basin</p> </li> </ul> <p>Hints for seeing the most stars:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Stay out long enough (about 30 minutes) for your eyes to fully adjust</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a red light filter on your flashlight to protect your night vision</p> </li> <li> <p>Visit during a new moon (time when the moon is not visible)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bring binoculars</p> </li> <li> <p>Choose a location without nearby obstructions like mountains\u00a0</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Ranger Programs</h4> <p>Interested in learning more about the night sky? Join a Ranger for an introduction to the cosmos at a famous Death Valley location. Programs are offered during the winter; check at a visitor center for the schedule.</p> <h4>Full Moon Night Hiking</h4> <p>While we don\u2019t recommend a hike at night in an area with obstacles such as rocks, a casual stroll at a place like Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes or Badwater Basin can be quite rewarding. Visit during a full moon for the best natural lighting. Make sure to pause to view the stars and to listen for wildlife. Always bring a flashlight and water and remember that nighttime temperatures can still be over 100 F (38 C) during the summer.\u00a0</p> <h4>Night Photography</h4> <p>Dark nights mean ample opportunity to photograph the stars. While there is no one \u201cbest\u201d location, astrophotographers often choose places such as Zabriskie Point, Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes or Harmony Borax Works to capture their night images. Please note that while you may park along major roadways while photographing, camping along paved roads is prohibited.\u00a0</p> <h4>Dark Sky Festival</h4> <p>Each spring, Death Valley National Park holds an annual event where visitors are invited to come and learn more about space and other worlds. The event lasts multiple days and includes special ranger programs, hands-on activities, and guest speakers from organizations such as NASA, JPL, Goddard, and SETI. Check the park website or ask a\u00a0ranger at Furnace Creek Visitor Center for upcoming event dates.</p>",

    "shortDescription": "Due to the extreme weather, it is not usually a good idea to bring a pet to Death Valley if you want to do any exploring out of your vehicle. If you are traveling through the park with a pet, and want to know where they are allowed to go, this is where to find that info! Stick to the roads, developed areas, and campgrounds. Pets are not permitted in the Wilderness or out of the areas listed above.",
    "longDescription": "<h2>Pets in the Park</h2> <p>Although pets are welcome in Death Valley National Park, there are many restrictions\u00a0for the safety of park resources, wildlife, other visitors, and even your pet. You may take your pet on roads and to developed areas such as campgrounds and\u00a0picnic areas, but they must be restrained or kept on a leash no longer than 6 feet (2 m) at all times. Pets are not allowed inside most buildings or on trails (including the paved trail to Zabriskie Point). Do not leave your animal in your vehicle. These restrictions do not apply to service animals.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Pets can go (on a leash no longer than 6 feet):</strong></p> <ul> <li>along roads</li> <li>in campgrounds</li> <li>in picnic areas</li> <li>in other developed areas</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Pets can NOT go (even if carried):</strong></p> <ul> <li>on trails</li> <li>in\u00a0the Wilderness</li> <li>inside most buildings</li> <li>out of developed areas</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Pets can have a negative impact on the park.</strong>\u00a0Dogs in particular may\u00a0scare or chase wildlife, pollute water sources and can become defensive and dangerous in strange surroundings. Domestic animals can spread diseases to wildlife, and vice versa. Pet owners are responsible for cleaning up their pet's feces and disposing of it properly.</p> <p><strong>The desert can be a dangerous place for pets.\u00a0</strong>Coyotes have been known to lure unsuspecting pets away, resulting the the death of the pet. Rattlesnakes may alert humans to keep a safe distance, but most pets are unaware of the danger. Spiny plants and hot, rough ground surfaces can be painful or damaging to your pet's bare foot pads. Desert heat and aridity can take a toll on pets and humans. Remember to always provide drinking water and\u00a0<strong>never</strong>\u00a0leave your pet alone in a closed vehicle, which can quickly become deadly hot.</p> <h2>Walking your Pet in the Park</h2> <p>Almost all national parks prohibit pets on trails and in the Wilderness, but pets are allowed on roads. Walking your dog along one of Death Valley's many scenic backcountry roads can be a rewarding alternative to trails, and in many cases provides similar scenery to that seen on trails. Many of the minor dirt roads receive light traffic, are surrounded by wilderness and seem like two parallel footpaths. Just remember to take your pet safely off to the roadside when a vehicle comes along.</p> <h3><strong>Suggested Walks</strong></h3> <h4><strong>Near developed areas</strong></h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Furnace Creek Airport Road:</strong>\u00a0Starting near the Visitor Center, this level, 1 mile (1.6 km) paved road edges the golf course and leads\u00a0to the airport. WARNING: coyotes are regularly seen in this area.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bicycle Path to Harmony Borax Works:</strong>\u00a0Paralleling Hwy 190 north of the Furnace Creek Visitor Center for 1 mile (1.6 km), this is the <u>only</u> trail in the park open to pets. The interpretive trail around Harmony Borax Works ruins is <u>closed</u> to pets, but those looking for a longer walk can continue on the unpaved Mustard Canyon Road.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stovepipe Wells Airport Road:</strong>\u00a0From the Stovepipe Wells Campground entrance this unpaved road heads across the valley floor to the airport and provides access to the Cottonwood Canyon Road.</p> </li> </ul> <h4><strong>In the backcountry</strong></h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Twenty Mule Team Canyon Road:</strong>\u00a0This 3 mile (4.8 km), one-way dirt road passes through colorful, other-worldly badlands. Vehicles are restricted to traveling in only one direction, but hikers can choose to turn around at any time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Titus Canyon Road:</strong>\u00a0The hike up the narrows of Titus Canyon is one of the most popular in Death Valley and because it is on a dirt road you can bring your pet along. The first 1.5 miles (2.4 km) is the narrowest, but you can continue as far as you want along the road. This area boasts spectacular scenery and excellent native bighorn sheep habitat; make sure you keep your pet under tight control to avoid endangering these iconic animals.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Echo Canyon Road:</strong>\u00a0Although the first part of this road is\u00a0open desert, if you have a high-clearance, 2WD vehicle you can drive 3 miles (4.8 km)\u00a0to the canyon mouth, then walk with your pet through the 2 mile (3.2 km) long canyon narrows to a natural arch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chloride City Road:</strong>\u00a0This mid-elevation road is a good option when the temperatures are starting to get too warm in the valley. From the Daylight Pass Road, walk the narrow dirt road winding through desert hills to Monarch Canyon (2 miles/3.2 km).</p> </li> </ul> <h4><strong>Other nearby public lands</strong></h4> <p>Death Valley National Park is surrounded by public lands that have less restrictive rules regarding pets. Contact the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Ridgecrest, CA or Battle Mountain, NV and the U.S.Forest Service / Inyo National Forest in Lone Pine or Bishop, CA for current regulations.<br /> \u00a0</p> <h2>Staying Overnight with a Pet</h2> <p><strong>Pets are allowed in all park campgrounds</strong>, but must be restrained at all times. No more than 4 pets per campsite area allowed. Pet owners should be good neighbors by keeping their pets quiet, cleaning up pet feces, and never leaving their pets unattended. Food and water bowls must\u00a0<u>not</u>\u00a0be left outside.</p> <p><strong>Pet-friendly lodging in the park is available</strong>\u00a0at Stovepipe Wells Village and Panamint Springs Resort, but extra fees are charged. Only service animals are\u00a0allowed in guest rooms at The Oasis at Death Valley.</p>",
