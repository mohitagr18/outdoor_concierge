    "longDescription": "<p>The Southwest Area offers steep slopes and sweeping vistas just beyond the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center. Vehicle access in the park is limited to the Southwest and Manzanita Lake Areas\u00a0in the snowy winter and spring seasons (usually December through April). Beginning at 6,700 feet in elevation, this area receives the most snow and offers steeper slopes than those found in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/snowplayml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Area</a>. The parking area is located in front of the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center, which offers the only visitor services in the winter season.</p> <h2>Sledding</h2> <p>Sledding is popular in the area surrounding the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center. Smaller, gentler slopes are located directly behind the visitor center. Steeper slopes are accessed via a short walk along the snow-covered park highway. <strong>Sled with caution</strong>; sledding is the number one cause of visitor injury in the winter season. Equipment rentals are not available in the park, be sure to bring your own gear.</p> <h2>Picnicking</h2> <p>Picnicking on the snow or in the parking area is a well-enjoyed activity on one of Lassen Volcanic's many blue-sky winter days. Self-contained barbecues are permitted in the paved parking area. Please bring a container to safely take charcoal ash home with you. Fires and firepans are not permitted in the parking area or in the oversnow campground.\u00a0<strong>Please dispose of all trash </strong>by taking it with you or placing it in the bins near the visitor center entrance.\u00a0Food waste is trash and includes nut shells, fruit peels, and food scraps. Animals such as the rare <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/nature/snrf.htm\">Sierra Nevada red fox</a> can become sick or die from eating trash.</p> <h2>Visitor Services</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center </a>is open 9:30 am to 4:30\u00a0pm Thursday\u00a0through Monday between November 1 and April 30. The visitor center offers a 24-hour lobby with restrooms, drinking water, and a 911 telephone. Free WiFi is available inside and immediately outside the visitor center. The visitor center contains a park store, gift shop, and pre-packaged snacks.\u00a0</p> <h2>Camping</h2> <p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/southwest-walk-in-campground.htm\">Southwest parking area</a>\u00a0allows overnight stays in self-contained vehicles\u00a0(no tents) as\u00a0the only\u00a0year-round camping opportunitity\u00a0in the park aside from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit-information.htm\">backcountry camping</a>.

    "longDescription": "<p>Snowshoes offer a way to explore the park in winter and spring, when roads and trails are hidden under snow. Each side of Lassen\u2019s main park road closure (southwest area and Manzanita Lake area) offer a variety of winter routes to <em>peruse on \u2018shoes</em>.</p> <p>Snowshoes are fitted with bindings that strap onto your winter boot. They have spikes underfoot to provide increased stability over hard-packed and icy snow. Decking is attached to a frame, creating a large surface area which prevents post-holing through deep snow. Winter boots are not the same as snowshoes.</p> <h2>Where to Go</h2> <p>In winter, there is no way to drive through the park. Most visitors tend to stick to one side of the road closure and access the park via Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center (southwest entrance) or Manzanita Lake (northwest entrance). Each side has multiple routes with varying length and difficulty.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">Southwest Area Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Visitor services, steeper slopes, and sweeping vistas)</em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-ml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Routes*</a></h3> <p><em>(Easier routes with gentle slopes and scenic lakes)</em></p> <p><strong><em>*Using the app offline?

Snowshoeing a trail can be much more tiring than hiking the same trail without snow. Remember to adjust your expectations of how far and how steep you can travel on snowshoes versus hiking in the summer.</p> <p>Snowshoeing strides are different than walking strides, as the shoes force your stance wider. If you\u2019re new to snowshoeing, we recommend trying different walking styles, such as swinging your hips more than normal.</p> <p>If the snow is particularly deep, use the kick-step technique to flick snow off the front of your snowshoe. As you are bringing your foot up, kick your foot to dislodge the extra snow. You may also need to stop periodically to pick out any snow clumps in the spikes of the snowshoe with a trekking pole.</p> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <p>Do not walk on ski tracks. Footprints and snowshoe tracks worsen conditions for skiers and using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</p> <p>Yield to faster skiers and/or downhill traffic. Step to side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill.</p>",

Only lures and flies are permitted; no living or non-living bait may be used.\u00a0The lake is not stocked, however fish stocking did occur prior to the park's establishment in 1916. A California State fishing license is requred. Please review all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/management/fishing_regulations.htm\">fishing regulations</a> prior to fishing in the park.</p> <h4><b>Boating</b></h4> <p>Kayaks, canoes, waders, and float tubes are commonly used. Only non-motorized boats are permitted (boats may not carry or use a motor).\u00a0All watercraft must be\u00a0launched from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ml-day-use-area.htm\">boat launch</a> to prevent damage to the shoreline wetlands.\u00a0</p> <h4>Rod and Reel</h4> <p>For fishing with a rod and reel it is recommended that clear six-pound test line or smaller be used. At times the lake is crystal clear, and fish can see heavier line. A light spinning reel and nimble rod are a good choice for casting long distances and a sporting fight.</p> <h4>Fly Fishing</h4> <p>Manzanita Lake is nationally known for its fly-fishing opportunities. For fly fishing, a six-weight rod is recommended with a length of 9 to 10.5 feet with a #5 or #6 leader. Due to the abundance of willows around the lake, fly fishing can be challanging. Waders are advised. Most flies will work, however a few popular flies that work throughout the park are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Callibaetis (#16-18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Damsel Nymph (#14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachute Adams (#14-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Traditional Adams (#16-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibaetis Cripple (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Carpenter Ant (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bouface brown (#10)</p> </li> <li> <p>Monroe leech, olive (#10)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0Manzanita Lake Specific Flies:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Midge Patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>Pupa Patterns,</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibraetis Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Damselfly Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripping Nymphs,</p> </li> <li> <p>Leech Patterns\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Wooly Buggers</p> </li> </ul>",

    "longDescription": "<p>The boiling mudpots and hissing steam vents at Sulphur Works hydrothermal area are accessible year-round via a two-mile\u00a0round-trip, over-snow route. Hydrothermal features are visible on both sides of the snow-covered park highway route and\u00a0heat from these features often keeps the portion of road between them clear of snow. This is the only <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/exploring-the-hydrothermal-areas.htm\">park hydrothermal area</a> that is accessible in the winter months (approximately November through April). The 30-mile park highway\u00a0closes to through traffic in the snow season (approximately November through April).\u00a0</p> <h2>Get There</h2> <p><strong>Distance: </strong>2 miles round-trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 6,700 to 7,000 feet<br /> <strong>Average Snowshoeing\u00a0Time:</strong> 1 hour</p> <p>To access Sulphur Works, follow the snow-covered park highway route from the Southwest Area parking area. The route passes the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center and a sledding area. The one-mile route climbs gently along a hillside above Sulphur Creek and offers a partial view of Lassen Peak at about the halfway point. The left side of the route is bordered by steep side hills. Be aware of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-safety.htm#avalanche\">avalanche danger</a> by watching for movement\u00a0on the steep slopes above. Near the end of the route you will cross Sulphur Works bridge and the summertime Sulphur Works parking area on your left. Rising steam and the scent of rotting eggs makes your\u00a0destination is unmistakable. From here you can return the way you came, continue 1/2 mile\u00a0up the highway route to Windy Point, or begin the steep climb to Ridge Lakes. View these and other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/winter-routes-sw.htm\">winter routes in the Southwest Area</a>.</p> <h2>Oversnow Travel</h2> <p>In the winter months, travel by snowshoe or cross-country ski is best for traveling over the deep snowpack. Bring your own equipment; rentals are not available in the park.\u00a0This popular route may be hardpacked, especially through the sledding area just beyond the visitor center. <strong>This route is recommended for advanced cross-country skiers only</strong> as footprints and snowshoe tracks on this popular route\u00a0freeze and make skiing more difficult. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/snowplayml.htm\">Manzanita Lake Area</a> offers better routes for beginners. We do not recommend walking without snowshoes unless the route is completely hardpacked. Otherwise, you should\u00a0be prepared for your feet and legs to break through the snow frequently\u00a0in an exhausting\u00a0experience known as post-holing. Learn about <a href=\"https://lnt.org/preventing-the-posthole/\">\u00a0why not creating postholes is good for everyone from Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics</a>.</p> <h2>Winter\u00a0Etiquette</h2> <p>Improve everyone's safety and enjoyment by adhering to the following winter etiquette recommendations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Do not walk on ski tracks.</strong>\u00a0Footprints and snowshoe tracks create hazards that make skiing more difficult.</li> <li><strong>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</strong>\u00a0Using a separate track ensures snowshoers remain clear of downhill skiers.</li> <li><strong>Yield to faster skiers or downhill traffic.\u00a0</strong>Step to the side to allow skiers traveling downhill to safely pass. In all other cases, yield to those traveling uphill, as they are working harder and have the right of way.</li> </ul>",
