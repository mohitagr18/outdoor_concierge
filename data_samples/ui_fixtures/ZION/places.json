You may not immediately think of the American beaver when in the Southwest, but the Virgin River provides a welcome habitat for this river specialist. Sightings are rare, but evidence of the beaver's activity can be seen on many of the park's Fremont cottonwood trees. They do most of their tree-chewing during the night when the cover of darkness helps them to avoid predators.\u00a0</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{73fbe6d5-2801-4581-af4e-14af52ccfaa6}{16}\" paraid=\"833899767\">Look</h3> <p>Have you seen any evidence of wildlife along the trail?

The North Fork of the Virgin River begins north of Zion at Cascade Falls, where it drains out of Navajo Lake at 9,000 feet above sea level.

The river drops roughly 7,800 feet in the 160 miles it travels. In the park, the river drops an average of 71 feet every mile. In comparison, the Mississippi River drops about one inch every mile. This steepness, caused by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, has given the Virgin River the ability to cut through sandstone and carve canyons.\u00a0</p> <h3>Look</h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{75f09f85-8dff-40ae-830d-60e08ccbd3ad}{3}\" paraid=\"593015807\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">When you look at the river is the water clear? Or is the water brown and murky? Rainstorms and snowmelt produce murky waters in the river as evidence of the sediment carried away. Once rain and snowmelt has stopped, the river can return to its calm and clear state in 24-48 hours.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <h3>Connect</h3> <p>Flash flooding is a natural hazard of the desert southwest but not in other parts of the world.

Erosion and weathering also play a role forming natural arches in the park. A natural arch is formed when deep cracks penetrate into a layer of sandstone. Erosion wears away the exposed rock layers and\u00a0surface cracks expand, isolating narrow sandstone walls, called \"fins\". Water, frost, and the release of tensions in the rock cause crumbling and flaking of the porous sandstone, eventually cutting through some of these fins. The resulting holes become enlarged to arch proportions by rockfalls and weathering.<br /> Architecturally, arches are the most stable load bearing structure, but through weathering, eventually all arches collapse, leaving only buttresses that will inevitably\u00a0give way to the unyielding forces of erosion.\u00a0</p> <h3>Look</h3> <p>Among the arches in Zion, one of the most visible is the Crawford Arch. It can be seen from the Pa\u2019rus Trail on Bridge Mountain, a thousand feet above the canyon floor. Bridge Mountain is located on the east side of the canyon\u00a0and is one of the tallest peaks along the trail. Once you locate the peak, follow the left edge down to where it intersects with the other peak. From the intersection\u00a0follow the small line of trees\u00a0to the right. Can you spot the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/arches.htm\">Crawford Arch?</a>\u00a0</p> <h3>Connect</h3> <p>Have you wondered why Utah and the Colorado Plateau have so many natural arches?

The rock is strong enough to support the weight of the arch but soft enough to be easily eroded by wind, water, and gravity. \u00a0</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Zion Lodge</h2> <p>The Zion Lodge is located in the heart of Zion Canyon and offers unparalleled views of the towering sandstone cliffs. The lodge has a variety of accommodations and is the only place inside Zion to eat; either in the main dining room (Red Rock Grill) or at the Castle Dome Caf\u00e9 (open seasonally). For more information about eating, visiting, or staying at the Zion Lodge, please visit their website at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zionlodge.com/\">www.zionlodge.com</a>\u00a0or call 435 772-7700.</p> <h4>Zion Lodge History</h4> <p><br /> In the early days of the National Park Service, railroad companies were often the catalyst for the creation or improvement of park accommodations. For Zion, that railroad was the Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. With the completion of a railroad spur line to nearby Cedar City in 1923, visitors now had an easy and comfortable way to get to Zion. The next step was to provide lodging that complimented the world-class scenery.<br /> <br /> While initial designs of the lodge called for enormity and immensity, park officials ultimately determined that a lodge in the narrow canyon should better harmonize with the landscape and scale of the surroundings. Gilbert Stanley Underwood \u2013 a frequent architect of numerous national park lodges \u2013 was up to the challenge. Using 265,000 board feet of lumber brought down from the plateau by the Cable Mountain Draw Works, the Utah Parks Company designed a main lodge building that was inviting and exuded warmth. The Zion Lodge was completed in May of 1925, and was later complimented with a series of stand-alone cabins nestled nearby. These improvements signaled an important milestone in a visit to Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> The main lodge building stood for over 40 years until it was consumed by a fire on January 26, 1966. A mere 108 days after the fire, a new prefabricated building was up and operating. This quick turn-around speaks volumes about the significance that the Zion Lodge had garnered in the story of Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> Whether you're looking for a shady respite from the heat or hoping to dine among a majestic backdrop, the Zion Lodge is a beautiful place to stop. Visitors can even attend\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/ranger-led-activities.htm\">ranger-led activities</a>\u00a0at the lodge, a service that started back in 1935. For many, the Zion Lodge has become a hallmark of a visit to the area, and occupies an important place in the history of Zion National Park.</p> <h4>Trails accessed from here:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>The Grotto Trail</p> </li> <li>Sand Bench Trail</li> <li>Emerald Pools Trails: Upper, Middle, and Lower Emerald Pools can all be accessed via the trailhead across the road from the Lodge</li> </ul> <h4>Shuttle Service</h4> <p>When the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm\">Zion Canyon Shuttle Bus</a>\u00a0is running, the Zion Lodge is shuttle stop #5 at the end of the canyon.\u00a0</p>",
